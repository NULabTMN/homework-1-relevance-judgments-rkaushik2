        <text>The Sixteenth Amendment
          The Constitution of the United States
          was purposely made difficult
          to amend. Madison, the
          'Father of the Constitution,' was
          against ''innovation' and Hamil-'
          ton' feared the turbulent, chan-'
          ging people. So the Constitution'
          was made unchangeable except b.
          a vote of two-thirds of Congress,
          and three-fourths of the State
          , Legislatures or State Conventions.
          One-forty-fourth df the voters to- j
          day, if prperly placoed, can block'
          any amendment. Of the four,
          hundred and thirty-five amend-'
          wents proposed from 1889 to 1904'
          noi one was aaopteu. it is tne
          belief of many people that the;
          Constitution can never be amend-'
          ed. I
          "We, on 'the other hand, believe ,
          Amendment permiting the income1
          tax, is possible, probable, inevita-'
          cle. The- resolution was. -unani-j
          mously adopted by the Senate,
          and. almost unanimously by the
          House. Thirty-five of the forty
          six States must ratify, but thirty-five
          States will be found. The
          South is for it; the west is for
          it; the real people of the East
          are for it; the two parties have
          declared in. its favor and Presi
          dent Taft has taken his stand on
          it. It is more than the mere
          question of an income tax, al
          though that is important. It is a
          question of national sovereignty,
          of the right of ninety millions of
          petTple to tax. themselves as they
          deem just and expedient. It is
          an issue upon which in times of
          danger the national welfare, ev
          en the national existence, might
          depend. The Sixteenth Amend
          ment nnist and will be adopted.
          But it will not be adopted by
          the people staying at. home and
          wishing for it. It must be made
          an issue in every 'State, in every
          assembly district. Time fights
          on the side of the Sixteenth
          Amendment; there is no limit.
          Once a State adopts it, the rati
          fication lasts' forever. But if
          the ratification is not made the
          first session, H may be again pro-,
          posed for 'the second, " third,
          tenth, or ninety-ninth time. If iwe

        <text>THE SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT
          IN THE LOUISIANA
          LEGISLATURE.
          (To the Caucasian)
          As shown by the House Journal of
          1910 the Sixteenth Amendment to the
          Constitution of the United States was
          endorsed by the popular branch of the
          General Assembly as follows
          Mr. Johnson of Washington intro
          duced House Concurrent Resolution
          No. t, ratifying the Sixteenth Amend
          mient to the Constitution of the United
          States, which was referred to the corn
          nittee on Federal relations. After due
          consideration this comlnittee reported
          as follows:
          "House of Representatives, State of
          Loutiiana, Baton Rouge, La., May 20,
          19to.-To the Honorable the Speaker
          and Members of the House of Repre
          sentatives of the State of Louisiana
          Gentlemen : I ant directed by your com
          mittee on Federal relations to submit
          the following report : House Concurrent
          Resolution No. i, by Mr. Johnson (of
          Washington) ratifying the Sixteenth
          Amendment to the Constitution of the
          United States (here printing the reso
          lution). Favorably.
          "W. E. RICHARDSON,
          "Chairman.'
          Two members of the committee dis
          sented and submitted a minority sub
          stitute.
          On June 2 this substitute was indefin
          itely postponed on motion of Mr. John
          son of Washington by a rising vote of
          68 yeas and 31 nays. The question then
          recurred on the motion to adopt 'the
          resolution to ratify the amendment. The
          roll being called resulted as follows:
          Yeas 78; nays 3t; absent 7.
          Thus it is seen that the House voted
          overwhelmingly in favor of the Income
          Tax Amendment.
          But in the Senate-As shown by the
          Senate Journal the Sixteenth or Income
          Tax Amendment was overwhelmingly
          defeated.
          On June 7 the House Concurrent Res
          olution by Mr. Johnson was so amended
          as to refer the said Sixteenth Amend
          ment to a general State primary elec
          tion for ratification or rejection by the
          qualified electors, said vote to be binding
          on the next General Assembly. The vote
          on this amendment was yeas 26, nays
          ii, absent 4.
          As amended the Johnson resolution
          was concurred in by the Senate by the
          following vote: Yeas 28, nays 9, ab
          sent 4.
          The Johnson Concurrent Resolution
          having thus been materially amended by
          the Senate was sent back to the House
          for concurrence in the Senate amend
          ment. The House refused to concur,
          and the amended resolution was sent to
          conference, both houses appointing con
          ferrees. There the Johnson resolution
          rests, and the Sixteenth Amendment
          failed of ratification in so-called Demo
          cratic Louisiana. On the South rests
          the responsibility. But the Democrats
          will elect a new General Assembly in
          1912. </text>

          There was nothing tn it yesterday
          but unless somebody spikes the guns
          before 1 -o'clock today the hair-raising
          stunts will begin and before sundown
          every judge in the state of Arizona
          and every man who has a few dollars
          :md sixty cents will have license to
          tremble in his shoes, if he is at ail
          nervous in his temperament. Rules
          have been adopted sufficient for the
          legal transaction of legislative busi
          ness and as soon as the decks are
          cleared for action this morning a
          concurrent resolution will be intro
          duced in both houses., submitting to
          the people an amendment to the con
          stitution providing for the recall of
          judges, and it will be passed quicker
          than either President Taft or the
          proletariat can say Jack Robinson.
          .Colore the smoke clears away a joint
          resolution will drift in. to the effect
          that Arizona endorses the proposed
          sixteenth amendment to the constitu
          tion of the United States, providing
          for an income tax. Thirty-one states
          have already endorsed it and only five
          more are needed. There will be one
          less today and the time has arrived
          for the plutocrats to throw up their
          hands, or at least stand up and be
          counted.
          Anyhow, that was the frame-up last
          night.
          TlHJt the legislature would do this
          very thing very early in the session
          has been expected, but it was left for
          the genius of Homer 'Wood, council
          man from Yavapai to inject the spec
          tucular coloring into the project. That
          is the. reason no more was done yes
          terday. It had been planned to do
          nothing else until these matters had
          been worked out of the legislative
          system. The houses were organized
          ami everything put in readiness, but
          with a clean slate until the soda pop,
          root beer or whatever the medicine
          was. should get the gentlemen in con
          dition for the effort, and now they
          are ready.
          It would seem to the ordinary per
          son that this state of preparedness
          ought not to be hard to attain but
          the ordinary person has little knowl
          edge of just how thoroughly the work
          was to be done. The democratic
          brethren went before the people
          pledged to put back the recall pro
          vision eliminated last December, pre
          cisely in the same form it appeared
          in the original constitution and they
          propose to redeem that pledge or bust
          their galluses. Homer Wood took the
          trouble to secure from the archives
          the identical official copy or the orig
          inal constitution, and swearing in
          blood that he would return the sacred
          document to its proper custodian he
          sought the lair of a photographer,
          where he had the recall section re
          produced with every pen-scratch,
          smear and fly speck, together with
          the yellow spots made by the tears in
          which it was bathed when It was
          found the section was for the time
          being to be ineffective.
          One of these photographic repro
          ductions will form the body of the
          resolution that Is to be introduced in
          each house this morning as soon as
          the prayers of the chaplains cease
          their echoing iind Mr. Wood can gain
          recognition of President Cunniff and
          Judge Wren or Yavapai can detect
          the nod or Speaker Bradner.
          After this deed has been done C. B.
          Wood will seize the earliest oppor-
          tunity in the senate and Don Babbitt;
          in the house, to present Arizona's j
          formal ratification of the sixteenth
          amendment to the constitution of the
          United States. These gentlemen did
          not have time to senu for the original
          copy in Washington to incorporate a
          picture in their resolution, but will
          have to express their sentiments in
          the artistic hand of an official typist.

          of the constitution of the United

          Sixteenth Amendment.
          Washington. Feb. 3.—The provi
          sion authorizing an income tax as now
          i?nnen.?nP£rtknown
          .of
          the federal
          constitu­
          tion will be as the "Sixteenth
          Amendment" and reads as follows:
          Article XVI.—The congress shall
          have power to lay and collect taxes on
          incomes, from whatever source de-
          w'",ou'
          apportionment among
          the states, and without regard to any
          census or enumeration."
          The change in the fundamental la'V
          or the land marks a new epoch in the
          American tax system. For the first,
          time congress is given specific authori
          ty by a provision of the federal con
          stitution to levy an income tax. All
          previous efforts for a tax of this kind
          have been without the explicit author
          ity of a constitutional provision. Tho
          change also marks a broad develop
          ment of the economic and fiscal s.vs
          torn of the a basis for taxation, simi
          lar to the systems now in force in
          Great Britain, Austria, Switzerland,
          Spain and various other countries.
          New Source of Revenue.
          Probably the most important aspect
          of an income tax. as now authorized
          by the constitution, is that it adds a
          new source of revenue for the govern
          ment. At present the two great
          sources of government revenue aro
          customs duties levied by tariff acts on
          goods imported from foreign coun
          tries and internal revenue taxes on
          tobacco, spirits, olemargarlne and cer
          tain other articles. Each of these
          sources at present produces a little
          less than half of the total revenues
          of the government. In 1911 the total
          government revenues were $700,100,
          906 and of this customs duties yielded
          $11.3,846,269, while internal revenue'
          taxes yielded $331,759,375. The re
          mainder came from sales of public
          lands, the corporation tax and various
          miscellaneous sources. Under an in
          come tax, however, a new and far
          reaching source of revenue ls provid
          ed for the government, and this will
          in turn reduce the amounts required
          rfom the other sources of revenue,'
          customs and internal revenue, in or
          der to meet the expenses of govern
          ment. This last phase is likely to have
          an important bearing on tariff legis
          lation as hereafter enacted.
          Before the amendment formally be
          comes a part of the constitution to.
          day's action of the legislature must be
          transmitted to the secretary of state
          at Washington and proclamation of
          the ratification made.
          First Step In 1909.
          The first official step toward amend
          ing the constitution so as to authorise
          specifically an income tax was taken
          by the senate on July 7. 1909. By
          unanimous vote, that body adopted a
          resolution, submitting this amend
          ment to the legislatures of the respec
          tive states. Only a few days later, on
          July 12, the house passed the resolu
          tion by a vote of 317 to 14.
          WIIjTJ T.\KK THAT TO REMOVE AVALANCHE OF .EARTH
          It ls estimated that in the slide at
          The movement took form during the
          tariff debate in 1908. Amendments to
          the Payne-Aldrich tariff bill, incorpo
          rating an income tax and inheritance
          tax measures were then pressed. Fin
          ially. President Taft sent a message to
          urging the passage of a tax
          upon "the doing of business by cor
          porations. measured by their income,"
          jand the submission to the states of an
          income tax amendment to .the consti
          tution.
          Senator Brown of Nebraska, fath
          I ered the amendment finally adopted.
          'As introduced and sent to the finance
          committee, congress was given power
          to lay "direct" taxes on incomes
          without apportionment. When the
          amendment was reported out of com
          mittee by Senator Aid rich, the word
          •'direct'' had been eliminated. The
          words "from whatever source de
          rived" were incorporated. These words
          caused sharp criticism before several
          state legislatures.
          Recommends Peace Measure.
          In the house the amendment was
          referred to the ways and means com
          imittee. One afternoon was given to
          deflate. Representative Payne, re
          I publican iloor leader, spoke in favor
          of piving the government the power
          as a war measure, but denounced it
          ias a peace measure by saying that
          he believed "with Gladstone that it
          lends to make a nation of liars." Rep
          resentative Champ Clark championed
          tho amendment as making accumu
          lated wealth pay its just burden of
          taxation, it was eventually agreed
          to by the house by a very large ma
          jority in which both parties were rep
          resented.
          The states were slow in ratifying
          the amendment. Alabama had the
          honor of being the first and only state
          to approve the change during 1909.

          One Governor Vetoed It. I
          A notable incident occurred in A1'
          k.'insas during the consideration of
          the amendment Boih houses of the
          legislature passe,-] a resolution of ap
          proval. but Governor Donaghey "ve
          toed" it. This "veto" at once raised
          a nice constitutional question. Rep.
          Robinson of Arkansas, made a speech
          in the house at Washington, in which
          lie challenged the rich' of a governor
          to ]ias.- upon the measure. it was
          paid to be th? first time a governor
          had attempted to veto ratification,
          ilthouch ii bad been customary for
          covemors io add their approval. The
          state department has included Ar
          kansas in the list of states ratifying
          the amendment.
          One of the most bitter contests
          over ratification took place in New
          York state. Governor Hughes, now
          a. member of the supreme court .of
          the United States, sent a messayo
          the legislature in opposition to the
          measure. He expressed himself in
          favor of ci-. ing congress power to
          enact .an income tax. but declared tho
          amendment submitted save the fed
          oral government the power to strike
          a fatal blow at state credit and state
          independence by taxing the income
          from state and municipal bonds. Si*
          prominent lawyers of New York led
          by Joseph II- choate. former ambas
          sador to England, supported the at
          tack by a rinsing memorial, de
          nouncing the amendment as having
          been rushed through the senate and
          house "almost without debate." and
          as giving congress power to hinder,
          ••if not prevent, the proper perform
          ance of the various functions of the
          states," by a tax on state and mu
          nicipal bonds. Tlicy pointed to the
          $20,000,000 New York slate bonds
          and the JSOO.OOO.OOO New York City
          bonds, as being within the power of
          congress to tax, if the amendment
          were adopted. Senator lluut took an
          active part in favor of the amendment,
          which was finally approved in a rcso
          lution in the form of a hill, but only,
          after a similar hill was defeated in!
          the first attempt to approve the,
          amendment,
          Dc.Wers Ave.
          Legislation must now be enacted by
          congress before an income tax may be
          .collected, the present amendment
          merely giving congress the power to
          levy such a tax. Only the most gen
          eral kind of estimates are being in-1
          dulged in as to what the government
          may receive under such a tax, as all.
          will depend upon the rates to be fixed
          by congress. In 1S66, under the civil,
          war income tax measures, $7^,000.000]
          was collected. The income tax law of:
          1894 was. estimated to raise $30,000.
          000 annually. Just preceding the pas
          sage of the amendment resolution by
          congress in 1909, Senator Bailey had
          introduced an income tax bill, esti
          mated to yield probably $80,000,000,
          proposed under the Payne-Aldrich
          tariff act. Senator Cummins introduc
          ed a measure, estimated to yield S40,
          000,000. The corporation tax measure
          has yielded in the neighborhood of
          $30,000,000 a year.
          The amount of the tax will depend
          largely upon the style of income tax
          levied. The 1S91 law provided for a
          flat tax of two per cent on incomes
          over $4,000. The Bailey bill authoriz
          ed a three per cent tax on incomes
          over .$5,000. Tha Cummins bill pro
          vided a graded tax. on incomes over
          $5,000, the highest tax being six per
          cent on incomes of over $100,000.

          states now possessing income tax sys
          tems of varying details.
          Has Been .Agitated for Years.
          Agitation over income taxes has ex
          isted in the United States since the
          civil war. The civil war measures,
          were allowed to stand among the stat
          utes without being stricken' down by
          the courts, largely on the ground of
          being emergency measures. In 1870
          a tierce debate occurred in congress
          over the continuation of the income
          tax measures inherited from the civil
          war. Senator Sherman led the de
          fense. claiming the tax was the "most
          just and equitable tax levied by the
          United States." The. tax expired'by its
          own limitations in 1S72.
          During consideration of the tariff in
          1893. the income tax question again
          arose. President Cleveland suggested
          an income tax on the income of cor
          porations. Representative McMillan otf
          Tennessee introduced the measuro
          eventually adopted as an amendment
          to the Wilson tariff bill. The author
          of the measure! declared that under
          the customs tariff the taxes had been
          placed on what men need, while under
          the income tax. it would be placed
          more on what men have and less on
          what they need.
          Senator Hill Was Leader.
          In the senate. Senator Hill of New
          York became the foremost leader of
          the opposition to the bill. He main
          tained that income taxes were the nec
          essaTy accompaniment of monarchial
          governments, but "they are justly re
          garded as odious and unnecessary in
          free republics." Senator Sherman,
          who fought the retention of the civil
          war income tax now opposed tha
          measure, claiming such a, tax ought to
          be levied by the states and not by the
          federal government.
          The measure came quickly beforu
          the supreme court of the United
          States which rendered the famous de
          cision holding the law unconstitution
          al. The decision was given by tha
          close vote of 5 to 4. The court held
          that the tax was a "direct" tax, and
          not being apportioned among the
          states, according to tho census, or
          enumeration, as direct taxes were re
          quired to be under the constitution,
          was unconstitutional.
          Friends of the tax were at once di
          vided into two groups. One advocated
          passing another income tax law de
          signed to overcome the objection of
          the supreme, court, and the other
          wanted to amend the constitution.
          Various projects were put forward
          from time to time, but it was not un
          til the present measure took form and
          was carried through to final ratifica
          tion that any practical results were se
          cured.</text>

          AMENDMENT IS RATIFIED
          AFter Fours Years Wait Enough
          States Approved Sixteenth Amendment
          TAXING INCOMES OF RICH
          Democrats Will Pass A Speedy
          Law To Enforce
          Measure.
          Washington, Feb. 5. Here is the
          Sixteenth Amendment to the Con
          stitution of the United States, rati
          fied Monday:
          "Article XVI. The Congress shall
          have power to lay and collect taxes
          on incomes, from whatever source
          derived, with ou t apportionment
          among the several States, and with
          out regard to any census or enumer
          a'ion." Wyoming had the honor of mak
          ing the amendment effective. With
          in two hours after word was received
          that the Wyoming Legislature had
          ratified the amendment, a telegram
          was received by Senator RichardHon,
          of Delaware, Btating that his State
          had also ratified the amendment,
          and to this was added New Mexico,
          making thirty-eight States to act
          favorably, Utah and New Jersey
          are expected to do the same. Only
          thirty-six were needed.
          The Democrats tariff makers of
          the House and Senate forthwith an
          nounced that thby would begin pre
          parations at once to enact an income
          tax law a3 a part of the Democratic
          tariff programme at the coming ex
          tra Session of Congress. Senator
          Simmons, of North Carolina, who
          will probably be the next chairman
          of the Finance Committee, spoke
          for the Senate. Representative Hull,
          of Tennessee, the income tax expert
          of the Ways and Means Committee.
          spoke for the House.
          Senator Norris Brown, of Nebras
          ka, Republican, author of the
          amendment, which he introduced in
          the Senate on June 17, 1909, with
          pardonable pride, announced to the
          Senate during the afternoon that
          three-fourths of the sovereign States
          had ratified it. He congratulated
          the Senate and the country on the
          result. The amendment will not be
          come actually a part of the Constitu
          tion until the notice of the ratifi
          cation by Wyoming or Delaware has
          been formally filed with the Senator
          of StatP, which will doubtless be
          within a few days.
          The Democrats propose to raise
          approximately $100,000,000 a year
          by the new tax and to graduate it
          so that persons of great wealth will
          pay at a higher rate.</text>

        <text>The Sixteenth Amendment.
          The Sixteenth Amendment to the constitution of the United
          States has been ratified by the legislatures of thirty eight states,
          two more than the required three-fourths. It gives Congress the
          power "to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source
          derived, without apportionment among the several states, and with
          out regard to any census or enumeration."
          Congress having been given this power what is its duty ? We
          believe that it should at once proceed to pass an income tax law,
          Some argue that no such duty devolves upon Congress ; that the
          amendment simply gives congress the power to act but that it does
          not follow that it should act at once as present conditions do not
          demand such action and the provision is solely for the purpose of
          giving congress the power to pass a law when the necessity shall
          arise.
          As viewed in the light of history, is this argument good ? We
          think not. The Sixteenth Amendment is the only amendment to
          the constitution in forty three years. In 1893 Congress passed an
          income tax law which the Supreme Court held unconstitutional.
          For this reason those favoring an income tax law proposed amend
          ing the constitution. Finally in 1909 both houses of Congress by a
          three-fourths vote passed the proposed amendment and now three
          fourths of the states by their legislatures have ratified it.
          Since a few years after the close of the Civil War, there has been
          practically as much need for an income tax at one time as another.
          The members of Congress believed that the people wanted this law
          or- they never would have passed the amendment, as most of them
          were voting to impose a tax upon their own incomes. The members
          of the state legislatures that ratified it also thought that the people
          wanted it or they would not have voted for it, because it is not the
          type of measure that is passed by a legislature against the wishes
          of the people.
          The people believe that an income tax is fair and just and Con
          gress should pass one at once. We can see no reason why one
          should not be passed. It is only right that the people who are re
          ceiving the largest benefits from government should pay for keep
          ing it up ; that those who can best afford to pay for maintaining the
          government should do so. A person's income is the best gauge of
          his ability to pay. An income tax it is hoped and believed will take
          some of the burden of the support and maintenance of the govern
          ment off of the shoulders of the poor and put it on the shoulders of
          the rich, where we believe it belongs.
          But it's opponents says that it will make a nation of liars. If
          a man will lie about his income to prevent paying a tax on it, he is
          already lying about how much property he has to prevent paying a
          tax on it. It is not making a liar out of him, because he was already
          one.
          It's opponents also say that it will be unjust, as incomes derived
          from certain sources are much more definitely determined than
          from others : that the man on a salary will almost certainly pay
          He lias lived the most of his life in
          more than the man, whose income is derived from investments and this neighborhood.
          fluctuates. Admit that this is true, what of it ? If we never make
          any arrangements for the levy and collection of taxes until we are
          certain that everyone will pay his share, we would never collect
          any taxes.
          Congress has been given the power to pass an income tax law
          because the people want such a law and they have given them the
          power so that the law will be passed at once and not in the dim and
          distant future.</text>

        <text>INCOME TAX LAW
          AGAIN ATTACKED.
          Washington, Sept. 23. Counsel
          for Union Pacific Railroad stock
          holders and others have filed a brief
          in the Supreme Court attacking as
          unconstitutional the income tax
          provisions of the Underwood-Simmons
          tariff law.
          The attorneys contend that while
          the sixteenth amendment empowers
          congress to impose a tax on "incomes
          from whatever source derived," the
          framers of the law stretched it to
          cover many taxes other than on in
          come. It is asserted, too, that there is no
          constitutional authority for taxing a
          specific class of persons, unmarried
          men, more than others, or for the
          super-tax imposed upon men with
          incomes over $20,000.</text>

          Supreme Tribunal Sustains New

          Macomber Test Case.
          Stock dividends are not taxable un
          der the 1916 income tax law, the
          United States Supreme Court decided
          today.
          A test caso was brought by Mrs.
          Myrtle H. Macomber in the New York
          Federal courts to recover taxes paid
          on 1,100 shares of stock of Standard
          Oil of California given as a stock
          dividend The loA'er courts decided
          in her favor and the Government,
          through Mark Kisner, then collector
          of Internal revenue for New York, ap
          pealed the rase to the Supreme
          Court. The declsloti of the lower
          court was sustained by the Supreme
          Court.
          The decision upholding that of the
          lower court was handed down by Jus

          .Justices Holmes, Day, Iirandeis
          hnd f'lark dl*s?\nted.
          "A stock dividend representing
          profits is income, no matter what the
          condition, in the opinion of lawyers,
          business men, bankers." said .lustice
          Rrandels. "It has been held Income

          Justice I'ittiey said:

          Svreeplnsr Effect Shown
          Tho sweeping effect of the decision is
          shown by the following
          "Thus from every point of view we are
          Drought irresistibly to the conclusion
          that neither under the Sixteenth Amend

          Constitution.
          Koprescntatlve Hull (Tenn.) said the
          decision gavo rich corporations and
          stockholders opportunity of evading tax
          ation to a large extent and throwing
          the hurden on the poor people and made
          possible the evasion of hundreds of mill
          ions nf taxes. With tho declaration by
          the court that taxation of stock divi
          dends Is unconstitutional, notwithstand
          ing tho Sixteenth Amendment, Congress
          leaders doubted If there was any legis
          lative step now by which the same pur
          pose could be effected. Likewise It was
          feared that aConstltutlonnl amendment
          on the point might not etand.
          The case just decided was appealed
          to the Supreme Court 'by the Government
          after Myrtle H. Macomber obtained a
          similar decision from tho Federal Dis
          trict Court for tho Southern District of
          New York. Lai go financial Interests
          made a test of tho case and employed
          Charles E. Hughes as chtet counsel. The
          In- i ' . ,!.. i r 'i
          nriiK sauc im menus in issue were
          1,100 shares of Standard Oil stock on
          which a tax of $1,367 was assessed and
          paid under protest. These dividends were
          part of a Kecalled "largo melon" cut
          by the oil company. The Issuanco of
          stock dividends has been quite common
          fllnco and many large sums of war
          rrofits were disposed of this way.
          Construction of Income.
          The majority opinion was emphatic
          In its declaration that the word "In
          come" In tho amendment and the law
          rould bo construed in no other way;
          whllo Justice Brandels In his dissenting
          opinion declared tho word "income"
          should be construed "as the people of
          tho United States In general believe It
          Fhouid mean and not solely on the In
          ttrprctatlon nf lawyers."
          Tho court hold that the onlv nucstlon
          to decide was what was i dividend
          capital or dividend and intimated that
          the fact that this system waa used to
          evade taxation could not enter Into a
          Judicial determination. With this view
          Justices Brandels and Clarke differed
          arsertlng the question should be dceldcl
          on "the much broader ground of public
          interest, with due regard for the law."
          The dissenting opinion of Justices
          Holmes and Day was based on the
          ground that the court misinterpreted
          ine meaning of the words stock dlv
          dend, and that it is clearly a dividend
          and taxable,
          One of tho points raised by the ma.
          lority was that nothing moro clearly
          Miowed that a stock dividend Is not
          Income than tho fact that to pay a tax
          on such a dividend one would have to
          eii other stocks or obtain revenue from
          oilier sources.
          "The essential and controlling fact.''
          said the majority opinion. Is that the
          ftocltholder has received nothing out of
          'tie companys assets for his separate
          Imposes a tax On the stockholder be
          cause of such dividend violates tho pro
          vislcns of Article 1. section 2, clauso 3 ;
          and Article 1, portion 9, clause 4, of the
          Constitution; and to this extent is in
          valid notwithstanding the Sixteenth
          Amendment"

          This is simply a clear income tax provision, confined to incomes
          alqne, and its adoption by-Congress, which seems certain, means that
          the country will soon have a federal income tax law. "Soon" means
          a couple of years or so hence, for it will take that long for State legis

          tbe spot in the evening the atteution is
          attracted by the brilliancy of three powerful

          An amphitheater of large extent, gayly
          painted in striking colors, the many hucd
          dressei of feminine toilets, and the ringing
          hearty laugh attest jovialty, good humor and
          furious fun. The apparatus, a narrow track
          acted in midair, which descends in
          curves and sharp inclines to the further side.
          T.vo trains of two coaches each are run over

        <text>HILLSIDE PLEASURE PARK. Newark's Popular Pleasure Ground. One of N'rw York's
          legitimate grounds* for boasting is that in many respects it sets the pace for other
          cities, notably as. regards amuse ments. While its own Coney Island is without a parallel
          in any other quarter of the globe, the marvellous success attendins that wonderful

          crowds of every reasonably large population centre. Wherever judgment has been used and a
          lib eral spirit displayed success seems to have at tended these efforts] For the
          recreation offered must be suited to the demands of those within its reach. An instance of

          thrifty young workingman who had labored at wire Weaving for fifteen years was seized by a
          passionate longing for an outdoor life, for green fields, fnr tvoodlcrds and for an
          existence where he wnujd not be ?hut up from a view of the skies. He plarsnr-J. contrived
          and indulged his fancy r.f;«»r working hours. He saved his wages and purchased land. His
          ideas took defi pit# shape. Hp bought shovels, rails, posts and built a ffv.rf. This

          JO-OW, whee-ce e, ooooo,
          gee-o whi-iz, but that was
          a bump!"
          It was our filcrnl from
          tlu sand dunes of Indiana,
          Michigan, Illinois, Ohio,
          Minnesota, Wisconsin, or
          any other state with plen
          ty of faiming districts,
          trying out a thriller at
          Coney Island, Atlantic
          Cilty, one of Chicago's big
          four amusement parks or
          for that matter at any city or town
          which supports these summer devices
          for extracting coin of the realm from
          thme plebeians.
          No matter how stolid he may be In
          life's ordinary pursuits or how emo
          tionless in an lnterurban wreck, his
          spine- curls, his sjmpathetic nerve
          system tickles and ho Is compelled
          to give himself up to thrills. You can
          find him in every resort whore there
          are scenic railways, roller-coasters,
          velvet-coasters, figure-eights., shoot-the-chutes,
          dip the-dips, leap-the gaps,
          ticklers and scores of other modes for
          shooting the electric currents up and
          down the spinal cord of the laughing,
          howling public.
          He is a source of amusement for his
          tutored city brother who tickles the
          day ledger with a pen during daylight
          and cavorts about on amusement de
          vices throughout the summer evenings.
          The city pleasure-seeker has much of
          this sport and the thrills fail to rise
          up in his anatomy the way they do in
          that of tho man, woman and child who
          are taking their first tutu at the
          game.
          Statisticians claim that there are so
          many actual thrillers of different cali
          ber and variety at woik daily in tho
          United States that If one should travel
          on overy ono of them, just once, the
          trip would take all summer. There
          were more this year than ever before.
          If all of the tides were strung out
          they would reach clear across the con
          tinent, high browed scientists claim.
          But that only goes to show that
          America is amusement-crazy. Tho
          populace and the elite, too, can't get
          enouph thrill. Not long ago, an Illi
          nois man with an idea pioposed to in
          stall an automobile in the parks of tho
          country and this device was scheduled
          to run down an Incline, turn n double
          somersault and alight upon its wheels
          again. America's thiillers are terrific
          and getting more so each year, but
          the man from tho middle west was
          perhaps a bit piemntuio with his
          death-defying machine. Sometimes it
          didn't alight as per progiam.
          Tho process of starting a thrill
          through tho pleasuie-seokers frame
          consists of lajlng out a device which
          combines both speed and tho unexpect
          ed. This subject has been studied
          by overy amusement manager In tho
          "United States and they can't get tho
          jumps, diop3 and bumps lowr enough

          Well, huitllng tluough tho air fastor
          than an aeroplane in working order
          cettalnly doesn't look safe, but at the

          made that romark did not know whore
          of ho spoko. Every single dovico, no
          matter how small, how liigo or how'
          "safe-looking," is requited to undergo
          a rigid test by the building commis
          sioners, before being allowed to accept

          There are also straps, chains, guards,
          etc., to hold tho patron In the car and
          If he or she falls out It Is little short
          of a miracle and only once or twice
          a season are accidents reported, so
          carefully do tho amusement managers
          guard the lives of those who provide a
          method of bread-winning.
          Perhaps tho scenic railway is known
          more generally to those who would
          lino their Interiors with momentary
          thrills. This rido consists of a series
          of cars strung together. There are
          brakes between each car and tho
          levers are manned by strong-armed
          boys from the railway yards. To them
          there aro no thrills. It's monotonous
          ns driving the cows home from pasture
          for them. Even catching a pair spoon
          ing while the train is running through
          the blackness of a mimic Canadian
          forest, can't mako them feel weary. It
          happens on every trip.
          Tho average scenic railway runs up
          a 45-degreo incline or rather Is hauled
          up by a chain and you are ready for
          tho first dip. The brakemen release
          their lovers and down tho cars go
          faster than tho New York-Chicago 1S
          hour limited. If the uninitiated puts
          his head between his knees ho Is apt
          to kick himself in tho face on the
          journey up tho hill which follows
          every dip. Thereforo If you haven't
          yet boon bounced around in this man
          ner, hang to tho Iron guard, stick your
          hat under your arm, grit your teeth
          and make up your mind not to care If
          your hair does get mussed.
          After tho train has completed tho
          first series of dips there is usually a
          journey tluough a dark recess, tragi
          cally known as tho "cavern," this
          being installed to give the spooncrs a
          chance to gloat over their nerve. Tho
          rest in a repetition, generally.
          Next in line as a death defying con
          ttlvanco Is the coaster. Thoro are
          fewer cars and not so many seats In
          each vehicle. Then, too, the coaster
          needs no hauling up a second Incline,
          for thoro Is only one, tho difference be
          ing noticeable in tho length of tho de
          scents. In somo patks in both east
          and west there has been a tendency of
          late to turn the coaster into a soml-loop-tho-loop,
          that Is to say, tho cars
          dtop off Iho top of tho' runway onto a de
          scent at an nnglo of about TO degrees,
          dtopplng about 80 feot, and then qtart
          up tho ascent at an angle which Is not
          quite so abrupt. Somo coasters havo
          only ono of theso terrifying dips, while
          others havo about 20 It seoms to tho
          first-nighter. Well, ono Isn't so bad,
          but about tho third jump you begin to
          calculato that tho seat must have
          slipped out tho bottom of the cat
          you're so high In the air most of tho
          tlmo.
          Passing on to another part of tho
          resort you strlko tho flguro-elght.
          Every hamlot has Its figure-eights
          theso days. That conttlvanco is fash
          ioned llko an "8" and much resembles
          tho coaster, except that the cars follow
          tho lines of tho figure, tho dips aro
          smaller and you naturally don't got
          so fussod up. It's tamer in fact, and
          for that reason graduation from tho
          figure-eight entitles you to piostlgo,
          which should carry you fearlessly over
          tho jumps which tho coaster takes and
          allow you to blandly hand tho "second-
          TBg JCgmC
          ride-lady" 20 cents for another trip for
          yourself and friend.
          Then there's the tickler. That's a
          new rido just put on In the west this
          season. You get into a round car and
          the device Is dragged up an incline for
          tho downward thrill. Starting down It
          enters a labyrinth of rails, the car re
          volving in ono direction and the de
          scent carrying it In another. This
          gives a remarkable opportunity to
          learn how it feels to bo jerked in two
          directions at tho same time.
          Tho Potsdam railway is a practical
          device, "made in Germany," which
          runs on an overhanging rail and which
          magnates among the Teutons threaten
          to mako a conventional mode of travel
          there within, a few years. The thrill In
          this consists of hoping It won't fall
          off this trip.
          Amusement-loving Americans also
          havo tho aerostat. Cars aro suspended
          at tho ends of long cables, you are
          locked in and tho device is started. It
          is like a Maypole, except that the
          cables don't become interwined around
          tho polo. As the speed Increases the
          cars rise higher at the ends of the
          cables and, inclined, speed through
          ether far out over tho heads of the
          multitude. Anyone who is susceptible
          to sea-sickness might possibly become
          immune by this treatment for 'the
          blues of everyday life. The giant
          swing, while it is not much like the
          aerostat, gives the same feeling to
          some.
          Then there Is the airship, which ma
          jestically winds about the outside of a
          tall tower and then winds down again.
          Merry-go-rounds aro numerous and
          despite the fact that this is tho father
          of all thrills, It still has its patrons
          among tho children.
          Among tho time-honored creations is
          tho shoot-the chutes, which consists of
          a slldo down a toboggan and a few
          bounces after tho boat strikes the
          wator of tho lako at tho bottom of the
          chute. If you're- wise you'll not sit
          In the front seat. Thete's where tho
          big bump comes and tho occupants of
          tho bow of the boat feel the leaps over
          tho water most.

          COW BROKE UP BARN DANCE
          Of courso, realism Is all well enough
          In Its way, but it can easily bo can led
          to an excess. Horo, for Instance, Is
          the case of that barn danco in the
          east, where an actual barn was tho
          sceno of ievclry.
          And In tho midst of tho fun a blood

          of the room. If it moves backwards
          from you, intuition tells you to stop
          forward. Don't step too speedily or
          you'll find yourself walking on tho
          ceiling, head down. Finally an open
          ing Is reached. You stop out onto a
          floor which bounces up and down as
          you meander along. A moment lator
          you walk upon what seems to be tho
          top of an airship, loosely inflated. By
          that time, if you're one of the fair
          sex, you need protection. The recess
          es aro all pitch dark
          Then, perhaps you are swayed by a
          wave-like motion of tho entire room,
          which very naturally elicits very prop
          er screams from the women folks,
          Freed from ocean-liner imitation, you
          are immediately Introduced to a 200
          miles an-hour cyclone, coming from tho
          floor, celling, walls and in fact from
          all sides. The floor begins to move
          sideways with a quick-jerky motion.
          You try to steady yourself on a rail,
          just perceptible in the blackness.
          Ouch! It's charged with electricity.
          Ahead aro soveial staircases and you
          feel rather relieved to think you're
          out of it at last. Reaching them safe
          ly you start up when, without warning,
          tho whole contrivance begins to move
          backward and forward, compelling
          you to grab tho rail for safaty. In
          darkness again, you try to make your
          way through a typical labyrinth of
          rooms. Feeling along the wall with
          ono foot ahead of you to ascertain tho
          nearness of bottomless pits, etc., for
          your mind's eye sees lots that don't
          exist, you bump your noso against a
          few barriers and eventually push
          against a wall, which gives way and
          you find yourself alone in a turnstile,
          inclosed on nil sides. When your ter
          ror has reached a burning point some
          one else behind pushes the wall as you
          did and you aro llbctatcd, only to
          again find yourself in tho midst of
          weird ghostlike cries and see skele
          tons darting hither and thither (on
          pulleys). A little scream Just at this
          moment might bo appropriate. Just

        <text>CELLAR DOOR APOTHEOSIS
          Gigantic Industry That lias Been
          Built on the Craving to Slide.
          The male American, from the time when his
          first trousers make him feel proud, has just one
          passion that is stronger than his love for at
          tending; fires. It is his desire to slide down hill.
          If during those early years he finds a cellar door,
          banister, haymow or hillside of snow or slippery
          i grass and does not try it? friction on hi 3
          trousers, then there is a good and painful rea
          son for his temperance ten rimes out of every
          ten. The female American, who at a tender
          ape makes herself as much like the male as she
          can. follows his example in this matter and
          slides whenever she dares to. minding her
          mamma only when she is afraid.
          And even in grown-up days, when you see a
          particularly fine mahogany stair rail sweeping
          down from top to bottom of a house, with a
          graceful, rounded on* spiral at the end and not
          a post or an obstruction anywhere — you kno^r
          what is the first thing you think of. And if you
          were quite sure that nobody could possibly see
          you, and that you wouldn't fall off. and that
          ! you could catch yourself at the end. and that
          I your stomach wouldn't get in the way and youß
          glasses would stay on — well, of course you can't
          be sure of any of these things. Only if you
          could, who knows what might happen?
          That longing to "let her rip," to surrender
          yourself unresistingly to the force of gravity,
          goes very deep into your being. It is civilized
          ' human nature crying out for contact with an
          essential force, crying to be set free, if only for
          an instant, from the paths of every day. hum
          drum existence. The longing is none the less
          deep because it seems ridiculous. It is a real,
          strong, primeval instinct. Now, in any strong
          human desire there is a great deal of money for
          the man who knows how to satisfy it and i 3
          willing to sell satisfaction at reasonable rates.
          Hence the roller coaster. It stands in Scot
          land, in Coney Island, in Brazil, in Yucatan.
          It is numbered in tens of thousands, and mill
          ions ride In it every year. It has made its in
          ventors millionaires. Yet they took only tha
          essence, the spiritual part, of the cellar door,
          freed it from its homely surroundings, exalted
          it. elaborated it, capitalized it and made it a.
          mint to coin the cellar door impulse into good
          currency. The mint works on a grand scale.
          The first roller coaster was 4.» feet Ion:;, an
          the highest drop on the line was one of ten feet.
          The thrill was somewhat more intense than that
          to be gained from a parlor rocking chair; it was
          rather more like the sensation of working 4
          wooden lawn swing. To-day there is a rolle?
          coaster at Brighton Beach where the track is
          11G feet high at one point, and there is a drop
          of eighty-five feet. "When the car plunges down
          that descent the passenger literally leaves his
          scat for an instant, and a3 he sees Coney Is!a:r4
          leaping up to meet him he knows how a base*
          ball feels when a .400 batsman swings on if t
          with the bases full.
          That first roller coaster cost $1,500. The bisj
          3cenic railways at Toney Island to-day coa|
          about $00,000 each. The smaller ones, such a3
          are shipped cut to Rio de Janeiro or Yokohama,
          represent an Investment of S-K,oo each before
          they have carried a passenger. It is estimated
          that 550,090,000 is invested in sliding- amuse
          ments of one sort or another in the United
          States alone. More than half the population o?
          the country lives within an hour's ride of ons
          or ancther of them, for they are in a thcusan 1
          of our clues. If the cellar door impulse is not
          turned into hard dollars it is certainly not for
          lack of the machinery to do it or of willingness
          to furnish the machinery. A single firm, tha
          same which operated the first ••switchback' in
          1884, now has $8,000,000 Invested in the busi
          ness. Its profits are enormous.
          In one season a roller coaster frequently pays
          for itself. Earnings of loss than CO per cent for
          a season are rare. Two thousand dollars is a
          good figure for a Sunday's receipts. The- fare 13
          10 cents a ride. That means that twenty thou
          sand thrills of cellar door satisfaction have be a
          mint, d into hard cash.
          Go to Coney Island and sec how natural the
          process is. When you have felt the cushion* d
          seat plunge down from under you and have
          caught your breath to tide yourself over the bis
          drop that is coming; and have felt tho car
          charge up the next steep slope with a rear :.r.l
          1 !-:.h that is good to hear, and when you have
          giuwu supercilious at the easy motion with
          which it takes the later undulations, and then
          have had the whole ride all over again, you '.vill
          come out at the c nd and be quite ready to own.
          that it is well worth 10 cents and that you will
          ride again, to-day or next week, as circum
          stances may fall out. You have it firmly ;L:c:i
          in your mind that it is worth 10 cents.</text>

          MISS KALLIGHAN WAS BORN IN
          HONESDALE AND LIVED ON
          ERIE STREET.
          Two women, Mrs. Alice Prevost, of
          Jersey City, and Mary A. Kallighan,
          formerly of Erie street, Honesdale,
          were killed Sunday evening when the
          last car of a three-car train on tho
          " Giant Racer," a high roller coaster
          at Coney Island, left the rails. Their
          bodies were Wedged between the side
          of the overturned car and tho guard
          rail and badly crushed. Two women.
          and a boy, the other occupants of the
          car, were painfully but not seriously
          injured.
          The coaster where the accident
          happened is about eighty feet above
          the street and firemen had to use
          scaling ladders to reach the spot and
          extricate the bodies of the victims.
          Miss Kallighan was born in Hones
          dale 41 years ago, where she resided

          lived In Scranton. The deceased was
          a lovable young woman and com
          manded the respect of many Hones
          dale friends, who are grieved to learn
          of her accidental death. .
          Besides her widowed mother, Mrs.
          Kathryn Kallighan, the deceased Is
          survived by five brothers and one
          sister, namely: Thomas, John and

          The remains of Miss Kallighan
          will arrive in Honesdale Wednesday
          morning and the funeral will be held
          from St. John's Roman Catholic

          turns? If you have experienced the
          sensation you know why some persons
          are so crazy about it that they refuse
          to get off until they have taken a dozen
          rides or more. ,%l~-

          COASTER AT RIVERVIEW
          A coroner's jury will investigate

          N. Irving Park, by a fall from the"
          "Greyhound roller coaster" at Riv

          alone in the car from which v he fell.
          It is believed that he had let go of.

        <text>Easterners Like It Rough
          “For real thrills a roller coaster
          today may be built with a ninety
          foot vertical dip and airplane dips
          as much as fifty feet out of line,”
          he says. "They give people a
          helluva ride. We can’t build ’em
          that way all over. In some places
          they’d scare the pants off folks.”
          Easterners demand the most ex
          citement on roller coasters, he
          points out. They get it at such
          amusement parks as the Palisades
          in New Jersey. Coney Island in
          New York, and Revere Beach in
          Massachusetts.
          Chicagoans, however, like their
          rides fast, too. For years they’ve
          liberally patronized Riverview.
          San Franciscans get their roller
          coaster thrills at Playland at the
          Beach where McKee built a fast
          ride a couple of years ago.
          “In most other sections of the
          country," he says, “I have to de
          sign roller coasters more con
          servatively. Even so, standing
          near the ticket booth you’re not
          as likely to hear people say, 'Let’s
          take a ride’ the way they do in
          the East. More often they’ll say
          ‘I dare you to take a ride.’ ”
          Doubt* Thrill
          Canadians, McKee believes, en
          joy roller-coaster thrills almost
          as much as Easterners and
          Chicagoans. He built two roller
          coasters for the Quebec Exposi
          tion which were a tremendous
          success. So was the double
          tracked racing coaster he built at
          Hanlon’s Point on Toronto Bay.
          For quick romance McKee is a
          firm advocate of a roller coaster
          Tunnel of Love combination. He
          always builds the two close
          together.
          “A zippy ride with plenty of air
          plane dips, like the one I built at
          Palisades, breaks the ice between a
          couple in about twenty-four hun
          dred feet or two minutes flat,” he
          explains. “They travel at a max
          imum speed of fifty-five miles
          an hour but it feels like a hun
          dred and fifty-five.
          “When they follow this up with
          a six- or seven-minute ride in the
          Tunnel of Love they’re bound to
          get even better acquainted.”
          Today McKee is speeding up
          all the thrill rides that he designs
          and builds. They are still as safe
          as ever. Patrons, however, like to
          think they have an element of
          danger, particularly the roller
          coaster. Operators do not dis
          illusion them.</text>

        <text>Roller Coaster Repair Man
          Dies After Being Struck
          By Thrill Car Train
          NEW YORK, GPL-For 23 years,
          Edward C. Santo had been a roller
          coaster repair man at Coney Is
          land, nimbly stepping from the
          tracks to the safety of a catwalk
          when the thrill-ride cars ap
          proached.
          Yesterday Santo, 43, apparently
          failed to hear a three-car train
          coming. It struck him as he was
          examining tracks about 35 feet
          above ground, and knocked him
          10 feet over to the catwalk.
          At the end of the ride horror
          stricken passengers reported the
          accident to Santo’s son, Edward
          Jr., 17, who was handling fares j
          and sending out the trains at the
          roller coaster entrance.
          Young Santo rushed to his fath
          er, who died a short time later at
          Coney Island Hospital.</text>

        <text>RIVERVIEW PARK DEATH TO
          CAUSE CORONER'S PROBE
          Coroner Hoffman today ordered a
          rigid probe into the accident on the
          "Jackrabbit" roller coaster at Riyer
          view Park last night that cost the life
          of Herman Knoffel, 15, 3452 N. Irving
          av. He was killed by a 30-foot fall
          after a "Jackrabbit" car had jumped
          the track.
          This is the second accident of the
          season at the Northwest Side amuse
          ment park and the coroner said he
          was determined to find out if negli
          gence played any part in the acci-
          L dents. Investigators were assigned
          to the work this morning. The loop
          press, in which Rlverview Park ad
          vertises extensively, are neglecting
          to print the news of Hoffman's probe.
          Knoffel was crushed between the
          -car and the rail and then fell 30 feet
          to the' ground. He died in the hos
          pital. His two companions were in
          jured.</text>

          WAS NEVER CONSCIOUS
          AFTER 50-FOOT FALL
          FROM ROLLER COASTER
          Tragedy Occurs
          Sunday Afternoon
          at Beach Resort
          Leaves Wife and Three
          Children in
          City
          Curtis C. Higgins, well-known lo
          cal man died Sunday afternoon,
          June 21st, at 4:45 P. M. in a Nor
          folk hospital from injuries sus
          tained several hours earlier when
          he fell a distance of 50-feet from
          the big “Roller Coaster” at Ocean
          View, Virginia, where he had gone
          on a pleasure trip.
          Higgins was employed at the
          Halifax Paper Company’s plant
          here and was well-known locally.
          Surviving are his wife, Mrs. Maud
          Taylor Higgins, and three chil
          dren: one daughter, Sylvia Rose
          Higgins, and two sons, Curtis Cel
          ton, Jr., and Donald Martin Hig
          gins. Besides his immediate fam
          ily in Roanoke Rapids, he is sur
          vived by his mother, Mrs. Arthur
          Boyd, of Cranford, N. J., one sis
          ter, Mrs. Elmer Freeman ,of
          Branchville, and a half-brother,
          Henry James, of Camden, N. J.
          Higgins, it was learned, had gone
          to Norfolk for the day with friends
          from Roanoke Rapids. He was the
          only one of the party from here
          riding in the “leap-the-dips” car
          at the time of his fatal injury,
          however. It is said he was riding
          in the front seat of the car with
          C. C. Barber, enlisted man attach
          ed to the U. S. S. Raleigh.
          Witnesses told police investigat
          ors that Higgins stood up as the
          car in which he was riding whip
          ped around the high curve at the
          west end of the riding device, and
          that the pull on the curve toppled
          him over the outside edge. He fell
          head first on the grass enclosure
          below, sustaining multiple injuries,
          including a fracture at the base of
          the skull, and died three hours
          later in a Norfolk hospital with
          out regaining consciousness.
          As Higgins stood up on the high
          curve Barber grabbed at him, it is
          reported, but the centrifugal force
          of the speeding car on the curve
          took him over the edge in spite of
          Barber’s efforts to hold on to him.
          It is said the Navy man had a
          narrow escape from Higgins’ fate.
          Higgins was given emergency
          treatment at Ocean View, later be
          ing rushed to the hospital in a po
          lice emergency wagon, where lit
          tle hope was held for his recovery
          from the first, as his injuries, be
          sides the skull fracture, included
          fractures of the facial bones, shock
          -and internal injuries.
          His death came as a great shock
          to his many friends in the city.
          Funeral services were conducted
          Tuesday at four P. M. from the
          home at 231 Washington Street,
          with Rev. Gordon Price conducting
          the services. Interment was at
          Cedar wood Cemetery. Pallbearers
          were: Joe Williams, Lonnie Gib

        <text>CATHODE RAY WONDERS
          Professor Sanford Explains
          Crooke's Tubes, Ether Vibra
          tions and X Rays.
          WAVES WITH A NEW WIGGLE^
          The Great Thing That Roentgen's Dis
          covery May Be and Things That
          It Is Not.
          Professor Fernando Sanford of the de
          partment of physics of the Stanfora Uni
          versity has just received a letter from his
          associate, Professor Carmen, who is now
          in Berlin, and who has investigated Roent
          gen's photographs with his X or un
          known rays. Professor Carmen doesn't
          say very much, but what he does say
          comes from a scientist.
          "I saw Roentgen's photographs the
          other day," writes Carmen in the course
          of his letter, "and heard Warburg, pro
          fessor of physics in the "University of Ber- I
          lin, and others discuss them. Lummerhad
          also seen then, and there seems to be no j
          doubt about the reality of the phenomenon. :
          * * * The photograph of the hand, in
          which only the bones and the ring are
          shown, is very striking. It is, however,
          not very sharp. A photograph of a mag
          netic compass in a wooden case, photo
          graphed through the case, is very sharp- I
          indeed. We know as much here as any,
          where, but there is yet no consensus of
          opinion as to what the phenomenon really •
          is. The natural idea is that they are lon
          gitudinal ether waves. They are, how- '
          ever, very faint."
          Professor Sanford is a widely known
          physicist, who has made some important
          discoveries in physical science, the most
          important of which were his photographs
          in the dark, with the so-called Hertzian
          waves, made three years ago, and he is '
          naturally keenly interested in Professor !
          Roentgen's startling discovery of unseen
          shadows, not made with light, and of a
          way to tix them on photographic plates.
          Sanford has experimented a little with
          Roentgen's process, and has secured faint
          results, but be has not had ready for use
          the proper apparatus, and is not ready to
          talk about his experiments.
          He talKed about Roentgen's work, how
          ever, yesterday, at the university, and ex
          plained, in a way that people of ordinary
          intelligence can understand, what Roent
          gen's discovery may possibly be. The :
          scientists are only guessing at the new
          thing yet, though many have opinion
          "The point of chief scientific interest in
          the matter, which is the theory by which
          Roentgen and others explain the phe
          nomenon, the papers say tittle or nothing
          about," said Professor Sanford. "That is,
          that he has discovered a new form of
          motion or vibration in the ether vibra- ;
          tions that are longitudinal instead of
          transverse to the Tine of progress. I :
          would not express any definite opinion
          about it. It would be only guessing, and
          there is plenty of guessing going on. It is
          a scientist's business to guess, but to find
          out fore he talks. A large part of the
          stuff and most of the pictures the papers
          pub are necessarily fakes. It is but
          natural that there should be a good deal of
          slopping over about such a thing, of
          course. * It is too early to make any
          uetir.ite predictions as to what scientific or
          practical value the discovery will have,
          out it is, of course, a thing of great in
          terest to physicists, and it may extend our
          knowledge wonderfully."
          Then the physicist led the way into a
          big laboratory, full of all sorts of costly
          scientific apparatus, and elucidated some
          what the story if Roentgen's X rays.
          The discovery and the process of Profes
          ior Roentgen (call it Kantgen, with a,
          short a and a hard g) began with a
          Crooke's tube, and the professor picked
          up a Crooke's tube and connected it by
          two wires with an induction coil, which
          was in turn connected with a two-cell bat
          tery. A Crooke's tube arranged for use is
          a hollow sealed shell of glass of any size or
          Ehape, from which the air has been very
          marly but not quite exhausted, and into '
          which run platinum wires connected with
          the opposite poles of a battery.
          The bulb of an incandescent electric !
          lieht is a pretty good Crooke's tube. The ;
          one that Professor Sanford picked up
          was made to show extra effects. It was of i
          two compartments— one a small one— be- I
          tween which there was free connection :
          through a slender glass tube bent double j
          and then into the form of a cross. Air or 1
          fluid passing between the compartments i
          would go up, around and back through I
          the cross. Ihe professor set the current at ]
          work and instantly the Crooke's tube be- i
          came a thing of beauty. Around one of
          the wire ends at one end of the tube there ■
          appeared a purple glow that was simply a
          mass of fluorescence in the vacuum. The
          wire itself gave out no light. At the other
          end of the tube was a much smaller fluor
          escence. The glass cross glowed with a
          beautiful greenish light, which seemed to j
          stream through the cross but not leave it.
          Now, this Crooke's tube, as it lay there j
          glowing with its strange light, was ready!
          to produce one of Roentgen's photographs ;
          if things had been lixed right around it.!
          Vibrations of some sort — X rays —
          were surely beaming from it in all direc
          tions, Bbisme through the box on which the
          tube lay, as sunlight would shine through i
          a glass case, and if the reporter had I

          Waves.
          [Sketched by a "Call" artist.
          possessed a sense capable of perceiving
          those rays he might have seen before him
          the skeleton of the professor of physics as
          one might see tron or wooden bones in a
          glass manikin when the white sunlight
          shone through it.
          But now don't think that this pretty
          light, the vibrations that the human eye
          is capable of perceiving, would have any
          thing to do with the Roentgen photo
          graph. Scientists would have said so,
          until Roentgen accidentally discovered
          something the other day, that arrange
          ment of batten', induction coil • and
          vacuum was setting up different kinds of
          vibratory motions that variously rolled
          out through the surrounding ether, air
          and solid substances, as a Big turbine
          wheel, for instance, might cause all sorts
          of heavy and light, slow and rapid, shak
          ings through the water and the mill. If
          that arrangement had been set up before a
          scientist a few centuries ago the only phe
          nomenon he would have perceived would
          have been the glow of light, because the
          particular vibrations producing it are the
          only ones of the lot that man happens to
          have a sense to perceive.
          Since a century and more ago when man
          learned by experiment to recognize the
          electric current by its effect on something
          besides sense, the ordinary force of the
          electric current would have been recog
          nized in that simple arrangement of Pro
          fessor Sanford's.
          That makes two things that would have
          been the limit of the forces of nature
          : which man would have perceived that ar
          rangement on the laboratory table setting
          into activity up to a very "few years ago.
          Then Hertz found a new sort of vibrations
          proceeding from an induction coil and es
          pecially from the neighborhood of an elec
          tric discharge and these are now called
          ; Hertzian waves. They are not light, heat,
          'or the electric current. They are vibra
          tions that flow outward from their source
          like light from a thing that glows, and un
          til Hertz stumbled on them so recently
          nobody ever dreamed that such things
          ! were bustling about in the universe. These
          Hertzian waves Professor Sanford knew to
          ! be in operation there.
          And now comes Professor Roentgen
          with the discovery that from this arrange
          ; ment described there proceeds what is be
          i lieved to be a kind of vibration more dis
          : tinct from the other sorts than the Hertzian
          waves are from light. No sense can per
          ! ceive it, and it is being recognized and
          studied by its effects, noticed now for the
          first time. It illustrates how little man is
          capable of perceiving. This was the way
          Professor Sanford talked over his Crooke's
          tube:
          "There are many peculiar phenomena
          which take place in Crooke's tube, and
          they have been studied for about fifteen
          years. If the air is entirely exhausted
          there can be no spark produced in one.
          They are generally exhausted to from the
          one-thousandth to the one ten-thousanth
          part of an atmosphere. The end of the
          wire connected with the negative pole of
          the battery is called the cathode, and the
          effect appears to proceed from the cathode.
          When the current is started the particles
          of rarefied gas are electrified and driven off
          from the cathode with great force.
          "If there is sufficient gas it becomes
          luminous tnrough the particles striking
          each other. When the particles can reach
          the walls of the tube and pound against
          them, they set up a fluorescence in the
          glass. I'robabiy they cause the glass to
          set up light vibrations in the ether. The
          cathode rays are not the X rays of Roent
          gen, nor are they rays of light. They are
          the steams of gas "particles as they are
          repelled from the cathode, and it is rather
          their effect which is talked about.
          "If I put certain substances near this
          tube they will likewise fluoresce as has
          been known for some time. It has not
          been known that the cathode rays would
          produce the same effect when the fluores
          cence was hidden, though it had been dis
          covered that when a tiny sheet of alumi
          num is set in the tube like a pane of glass
          the cathode rays striking on this opaque
          window would produce a fluorescence in a
          proper substance placed behind it.
          "Roentgen accidentally discovered in
          his laboratory that a sheet of paper moist
          ened with double cyanide of barium and
          platinum and left near a Crooke's tube
          when the tube was covered with a black
          cloth would show fluorescent effects, show
          ing that the cloth was transparent to the
          cause of the fluorescence. He followed
          this discovery with his experiments. The
          effects secured can hardly be explained by
          any knowledge or theories held before.
          The rays from the Crooke's tube, which
          produced Roentgen's new fluorescent ef
          fects and later his photographic effects
          after passing through wood and flesh, are,
          of course, not light, and they are not
          Hertzian waves evidently. His theory is
          that the gaseous particles, striking against
          the glass, produce a vibration which sets
          up waves or vibrations in the ether dif
          ferent from any other kind of motion. He
          thinks that they are longitudinal ether
          waves.
          * "We have no sense that enables us to
          take cognizance of the ether as we can of
          light and heat, but we know that light
          and radiant heat are vibrations in an elas
          tic medium, and we call that medium the
          ether. It must pervade all bodies, because
          some form of radiation can pass through
          all bodies at a velocity far greater than it
          would be if the bodies themselves trans
          mitted it. The ether is as real to physicists
          as matter. We know only one kind of
          ether waves, and they are now all included
          in the term radiation. We know no limit
          to their lengths. One very small octave
          in the range of wave lengths we can per
          ceive by the eye as light.
          "Now, every kind of ether waves or vi
          brations that we know anything about
          can be reflected, refracted and polarized.
          "We also know that all the kinds of ether
          waves with which we are acquainted are
          transverse vibrations; that is, the vibra
          tions are back and forth across the line or
          plane of motion, like waves in water or in
          a rope when it is shaken, or like the vibra
          tions of a string. When we speculate
          about Roentgen's rays being longitudinal
          THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1896.
          Hand, photographed from life on January 17, 1890, X rays being used after the method of
          Professor Roentgen in the
          Physical Staat Laboratory of Hamburg. The plates, while the picture was taken, were lying
          in a closed box. The
          rays had to penetrate the hand, as well as the wooden cover of the box.
          [Reproduced from a. photograph made in Hamburg. Sent by Henri Windel, Berlin.]
          vibrations in the ether we mean that they
          are liKe sound vibrations, in which the vi
          brations are back and forth on the line of
          motion without crossing it. In sound vi
          brations tte air goes out on a straight
          line, stops with a condensation and goes
          on again. Sound is the only kind of longi
          tudinal vibrations we know anything
          about.
          "It has been recognized by physicists
          ! that there is no theoretical "reason why
          j there should not be longitudinal in
          ; the ether, but it has been supposed that the
          | ether was so nearly incompressible- that
          i the waves would have almost infinite
          j velocity and length and hence could not
          ibe perceived. All elastic bodies, solid,
          : liquid and gaseous, transmit, longitudinal
          • waves, and as the ether is an elastic body
          it would certainly transmit them too.
          i Roentgen has discovered that his new rays
          i cannot be reflected, refracted or polarized,
          as we can do with all known kinds of ether
          \ vibrations. So Roentgen thinks that lie
          has discovered a new kind of radiation.
          What longitudinal ether waves would do
          we do not know.
          "Whatever Roentgen's discovery may
          j b-5 it is an important find. Anything that
          ; will throw light on electrical phenomena
          I is of value to science. We are calling on
          the ether to explain heat, light and elec
          trical effects, and probably all effects
          which we class under chemical and mag
          • netic attractions and repulsions, and even
          i gravitation, as far as we have any hope of
          . explaiuing it.
          "It should be remembered that we have
          before produced photographs with electrical
          i waves not luminous, and others have done
          i to a certain extent what Roentgen has
          done and without the aid of light, except,
          j we can refract and reflect the waves which
          , have been presumed to produce the effects.
          : In 1893 I produced photographs in the dark
          ! with the use of electrical waves, and I have
          attributed them to the Hertzian waves. It
          j is barely possible that my pictures were
          ' due to the X rays.
          ! "A great general misconception about
          ! Roentgen's discovery and its possibilities
          i would be corrected if it were remembered
          that his rays cannot be reflected by any
          i thing or refracted by a lens of any sub
          stance. Hence no image can be produced.
          The rays pass through substances trans
          j parent or translucent to them and cast
          shadows on the negative which are fixed
          there. It is wholly the fixation of shad
          ows. The bones of the hand being opaque
          to the rays cast their shadow on the plate
          when the rays pass through the hand. The
          negatives used are prepared for the effect
          of light. Negatives better adapted to these
          rays may be expected to be invented."
          Professor Sanford set up the simple ap
          paratus by which he photographed coins
          and so on in the dark three years ago.
          Two wires were run from an induction coil
          connected with a battery. A thin little
          box was the whole photograph gallery.
          One wire was passed into the box on each'
          side. One wire connected with a medal
          fastened to the side of the box. The other
          wire connected with a metal plate facing
          the medal. Between the two was slipped
          a negative shut up in a plate-holder and
          the current turned on. The experiment
          was not carried through, but if it had been
          the plate, after fifteen or twenty minutes,
          would have shown, on development, a fair
          picture of the medal. Sanford's theory is
          or was that the Hertzian waves beamed
          back and forth between the medal and the
          metal plate, passing through both the nega
          tive and its case, which ere transparent
          to these mysterious new Hertzian vibra
          tions. The medal becomes, as it were,
          glowing with unseen Hertzian waves, to
          which the wood is as glass. The raised
          parts of the medal being nearer the nega
          tive, though ever so little,, would produce
          a deeper effect for that reason, and this
          effect would be reproduced in the printing.
          But then maybe it was longitudinal waves
          in there. - , .

          Lecture and Demonstration Before

          Prominent People.
          OTHDCG KNOWN OF NEW FORCE.
          Outline of Discovery of "X-Ray"
          of Apparatus Used In Generation.
          Many Kinds of Tubes In Use Demonstration
          Showing Bones of the Fingers. Etc.
          Some seventy-five invited guests
          .gathered in the lecture room of Pauahi
          Hall on the Punahou College grounds
          last evening for the purpose of listening
          to a lecture and demonstration on
          the "X Ray" by Dr. Lauschner, acting
          surgeon aboard the Australia. Dr.
          Lauschner being a graduate of the
          Berlin and Heidelberg universities and
          a pupil of a number of the leading
          scientific men of Germany coupled with
          the fact of the gentlman's reputation
          as a lecturer, called out nearly all of
          those who had been invited.
          Before the lecture those who came
          in were shown plates of hands, legs and
          arms with the bones visible. One of
          these was the beautifully shaped
          bands of a Jady with an engagement
          ring upon it This caused more than
          one question to be asked during the
          evening. All the plates were made
          by Dr. Lauschner.
          President Hosmer introduced the lecturer
          with a few appropriate remarks
          and Dr. Lauschner proceeded with his
          talk and demonstrations.
          The Roentgen or "X Ray" had
          created one of the greatest sensations
          ever made by discoveries in the realm
          of science.
          Dr. Lauschner dwelt upon the importance
          of demonstration in lectur
          ing on such topics as the one under
          discussion. He then explained the
          apparatus for photographing by means
          of the "X Ray," saying that each one
          of the parts was nothing new but on
          the contrary, something that had been
          employed before in obtaining other results.
          There was first of all the all-important
          current. Then there was
          the induction coil and last but not
          least, the Crooks tubes. The last had
          been used by Prof. Crooks for a number
          of years, were taken up by Lenhart
          and lastly, were employed by Roentgen
          himself.
          The discovery of the "X Ray" was
          not merely accidental. Roentgen had
          experimented on the nature of the
          ray obtained from the cathode terminal
          for some time. Last year while
          experimenting with a piece of paper
          covered with a double salt he discovered
          what he found to be a new force.
          At that time he thought that since the
          force came from the cathode terminal
          it must be some modification of the
          cathode ray but he found he was mistaken.
          In the "X Ray" the X repre
          sents a totally unknown quantity. No
          one knows what it is. No one knows
          anything of the nature of the ray.
          However, something is known of some
          of its products and effects. It will be
          some time before any one finds out
          what the rays are.
          Scientists have hesitated in making
          assertions as to what the rays may be
          because if they do they will have to
          overthrow accepted theories that have
          been, in existence for many years.
          Dr. Lauschner then told of the great
          number of tubes that had been made
          since the "X-Ray" discovery. The one
          used by him was of English make and
          was standard. The connection of one
          of the terminals to the mirror of alu
          minium and the concentration of the
          rays at a point just before the platinum
          disc together with other points in the
          photosraphv of solid objects by means
          of the "X-Ray" were explained, after
          which the lights were turned out and
          the demonstration began.
          Dr. Lauschner held up a "screen'
          made out of a thin film of some white
          substance in front of the tuba containing
          the rays and then inserted his hand
          between the two, bringing it Into di
          rect contact with the screen. Immediately
          there were exposed to view the
          bones of the fingers and hand. This
          done a thick book was placed in the
          same position and directly behind it
          was put a small
          two silver pieces. The metal bindings
          of the pocket-book together with the
          coins were plainly visible.
          After all had seen these wonderful
          things, Dr. Lauschner made a few remarks
          bearing on the subject in hand
          and then closed.
          Dr. Lauschner bears the distinction
          of being the first to lecture before a
          Honolulu audience on the subject of the
          "X-Ray," and he has the hearty thanks
          of all those present for a pleasant and
          instructive evening.

          All records of the long-winded litigation
          appear to be broken by some
          German litigants. The story is as
          follows: On June 21, 1596, the peasant
          people of Burgsinn, a small
          hamlet in Bavaria, brought suit
          at the Court of Speyer against the
          Barons "Vbn Thuegan for the possession
          of a certain body of oak and beech
          land which they claimed as their own.
          For 300 years, generation after gener
          ation of these poor people have managed
          to scrape together enough money
          to carry on this suit against the powerful
          barons, and a final decree was rendered
          in their favor, which went into
          effect June 20, 1S96, just 300 years after
          the suit was begun. The tract of land
          is valued at ?500,000. The inhabitants
          of Burgsinn had a big celebration on
          June 21; in commemoration of the tercentenary
          of their lawsuit
          The following, notice was recently
          pasted by the vice-president of a large
          manufacturing firm in St Louis: "Notice
          To Our Employes: Upon short
          notice being given, you may receive
          equal to two dollars for one, in sums of
          even dollars due you on pay-day. For
          example, if your envelope shows, say,
          ?6 due, you may draw what equals 12
          in actual silver as the Mexican dollai
          is intrinsically more valuable than the
          American dollar by about 4 per cent;
          so, while you do not get quite two for
          one on the face of the coin, you actually
          get two for one in real silver. You
          can thus double up your weekly earnings.

          of this offer will please sign

          signed it. St Louis Post-Dispatch.
          Although the consensus of scientific
          opinion at the present time, tends to
          the belief that the X rays partake of
          the nature of ultra violet light, yet no
          less an authority than 'Nikola Tesla
          advances a diametrically opposed theory;
          namely, that the Roentgen rays
          are due to a molecular bombardment
          of material particles moving with very
          great velocity. Tesla bases his theory
          on many experiments, which to him
          appear crucial, exhibiting phenomena
          incapable of explanation on an ultra
          violet light basis. He further states
          that he believes the material particles
          composing the bombardment stream
          are in some elementary condition not
          heretofore known, and that perhaps
          the ray may consist of streams of the

          "which the world could not well do with
          out; but, if much of that which has
          been contributed were swept away,
          leaving only its last, greatest and most
          wonderful achievement, the X ray dis
          covery, the world could bear the loss.
          There are substitutes for them; but
          none for the X ray.
          The telegraph, telephone, electric
          light and electric railway, as factors
          in the world's progress, have aone won
          ders in bringing nations and individ
          uals nearer together and increasing the
          volume of business transacted in a
          given length of time, but even these are
          limited in their scope, while the prov
          ince of the X ray is world-wide.
          As demonstrated by the experiments
          of Dr. William J. Morton and others,
          this light, to which nearly all so-called
          opaque materials are as transparent
          as glass is to the ordinary daylight,
          enables the physician and surgeon to
          lcok into the human frame as one looks
          into a room through a window.
          Scarcely has this discovery been pub
          lished to the world by Professor Roent
          gen, when thousands of men of all pro
          fessions are busily engaged in experi
          menting toward the perfection of its
          production and the multiplication of its
          useful applications. And thousands

          nounced by experts the finest in the country. Dr. Morton is looking at the botv-s in
          his hand through the tluoroscope. while Mr. Hammer is having an X-ray picture

          more are awaiting information which
          will enable them to handle this benefi
          cent gift intelligently.
          Never, perhaps, in all history has a
          discovery so far-reaching in its effects
          upon the well-being of humanity in
          general been brought before the world.
          It makes surgery an exact science, and
          places the healing art far beyond the
          groping amid fleeting symptoms into
          the realms of certainty. Wherever dis
          ease or accident have preyed upon or
          marred the Integrity of the human
          form, its members or organs, there will
          this greatest wonder of the nineteenth
          century, like a ministering angel, fold
          its wings and shower its blessings.
          Almost as wonderful as the discovery
          of the X rays is the fact that within
          n few months after its announcement
          the press is spreading broadcast the
          latest and most complete Information
          upon the subject from the pens of those

          Individual professions.
          Aside from his standing as one of the
          leaders in the medical profession, Dr.
          Morton has been identified with Profes
          sor Roentgen's discovery as one of the
          earliest and most active experimenters
          in this new field, and With the most
          fully equipped X ray laboratory, has
          justified all expectation* by producing
          a large number of the finest X ray pho
          tographs thus far produced in the
          world. Not content with hands, feet
          and other minor portions of the body,
          he has taken photographs of the en
          tire trunk, pelvis, etc., which have been
          by compentent authorities, pronounced
          wonderful in their perfection of detail,
          and of inestimable value in surgical op
          erations.

          '"The X ray, or Photography of the
          Invisible," gives a clear and exact ex
          planation ofthe theory of the X rays,
          as well as the method of arranging and
          operating the apparatus involved in
          their production. To this end the work
          commences by explaining in simple
          language and comparison with well
          known objects the nature of electricity,
          the method of and means for measuring
          it and the various means and devices
          for generating and controlling it, each
          and all of the devices referred to being
          carefully illustrated and described.
          Step by step, the reader is carried
          from one point of interest and informa
          tion to another, until every detail of
          theory, practice, process and imple
          ment is made clear, and anyone of or
          dinary intelligence may, by acting care
          fully upon the information conveyed,
          produce perfect X ray photographs.
          To the physician, far away from the
          great centers of learning, who must rely
          entirely upon himself for all that is
          necessary of intelligence and mechani
          cal skill to carry out his experiments,
          this work will prove invaluable.
          To the electrician and amateur it is a
          clear guide; each step being laid down
          by men who have, so to speak, paced
          off the entire road from start to finish.
          To a large majority of the intelligent
          public, electricity is a mystery, and is
          likely to remain so for aught they will
          do to make it otherwise. And this con
          dition results from the erroneous im
          pression that one must have received a
          special training to comprehend it. "The
          X Ray; or, Photography of the Invisi
          ble," makes a very successful effort to
          disabuse the public mind of this false
          conception. Commencing with those
          werds —so meaningless to the average
          individual —the volt, ampere, watt, etc.,
          it makes clear their individual mean
          ing, the-ir relation to each other, and
          incidentally, the varying conditions of
          ian electric current which makes them
          i roperly express its state of rest or ac
          tivity, of potentiality or performance.
          Having learned how to measure a
          current of electricity, we are taught
          how to create, or more properly speak
          ing, how to generate it, the various
          m urces from which it may be derived,
          the means of conducting it from place

          it where we would have it remain.

          tric current, animal, frictional. chemi
          cal, to me chanical, all is made sei sim
          ph that we almost wonder we escaped
          kne>wing it by intuition.

          Photographic apparatus is next
          treated in a general way, and is fol
          lowed by a carefully written and illus
          trated chapter on the choice of appara
          tus, and how to properly arrange and
          connect it, after which follows a val
          uable chapter on the nature and source
          of the X rays, which is exceedingly in
          teresting.
          One of the most interesting and valu
          able chapters to the prospective experi
          menter is that which, clearly and in de
          tail, explains the exact operation in
          volved in producing an X ray photo
          graph both directly from the object and
          by aid of the fluoroscope. If the several
          steps of the operation are not thorough
          ly understood, the operator may take
          our word for it that it is his own fault,
          and read these pages over again and
          again until he has fully grasped their
          meanfng.
          This part of the w T ork closes with a
          chapter of photographic notes on de
          veloping, etc.
          A chapter of the surgical value of the
          X rays, their usefulness in discovering
          foreign bodies imbedded in the flesh or
          bones of a person, its application to
          dentistry, etc., and finally the consider
          ation of their curative properties,
          brings this interesting, instructive and
          valuable work to a close. An appendix,
          or rather three of them, giving the orig
          inal paper on the X ray by Professor
          Fig. 36.
          Fig. 36 is a Morton vacuum bulb fitted
          with external electrodes of aluminum foil
          devised in the first instance for use with
          a Holtz or other influence machine, but
          equally useful in connection with an in
          duction coil. The small aluminum cap A
          is cathodic and concentrates the rays on
          the opposite end of the bulb. The anode
          B is a cup of aluminum foil covering a
          large proportion of the bulb as shown in
          the sketch. The innovation in this form
          of bulb or tube lies in the fact that the
          cathodic stream, as it impinges on the
          anode, apparently proceeds on its way in
          the form of X rays: therefore this type
          Fig. 37.
          is not a "reflecting" tube. It will be no
          ticed there is no window or opening in the
          anode. Should a window be cut in the
          anodic metal with the hope of getting a
          better effect upon the sensitized plate, the
          efficacy of the bulb will be greatly dimin
          ished. This bulb works well with a static
          machine (or with an induction coil).
          This idea of a coincident X ray and
          cathodic stream as applied to a tube hav
          ing external electrodes has been modified
          by the originator of the above, as illus
          strated in Fig. 37. The focusing cathode
          cup A is of aluminum, and the thin disk
          or button B Is of carbon and is held tirmly
          in its position by the anode connection
          passing through the glass. It will be seen
          that the X rays appear to pass through
          the anode instead of being reflected
          from it.

          wonderfully interesting subject, and an

          addition to the large number of illustra
          tions forming part of the text, has a
          piece in colors, clearly differentiating
          the X rays from the anode and cathode
          rays, while thirty-two pages of ex

          by half-tone plates from X ray nega
          tives taken by Dr. Morton and pro
          nounced by scientists to be the most
          valuable collection in the country.

          REDUCTION OF VACUUM BY AR
          TIFICIAL MEANS.—An important tube
          for perfect X ray work designed by Dr.
          Morton. When it was first noted that the
          vacuum of a tube became raised to an im
          practicable point, it was lowered by put
          ting the tube in an oven and heating it to
          400 or 500 degrees, or by boiling it in oil.
          But the delay and trouble of doing this
          may be avoided by the simple operation of
          heating the tube in its working position by
          aid of a spirit lamp or a Bunsen burner.
          For instance, the operator begins work
          with a tube whose vacuum forces a six
          inch spark to pass between the discharg
          ing rods of the coil. This may not leave
          him enough margin of capacity in his
          coil, so he turns off the current and care
          fully heats the tube with the tlame of a
          spirit lamp. This must be done boldly and
          yet carefully. The tlame should be ample
          and swayed across the hottom of the tube,
          never resting in one place, until at last
          the entire tube has become evenly hot;
          then the lamp is withdrawn to a distance
          and the current turned on. If the sparks
          still fly around the outside of the tube the
          heating must be continued.
          Finally there comes a moment when,
          upon turning on the current, it passes
          through rather than outside of the tube,
          and then X ray work may begin. The am
          ateur will often have an exciting time
          with his vacuum. Once lowered he may
          sometimes keep it low by using a current
          strength which keeps his platinum re
          flector (if a focus tube is employed) red
          hot.
          But at last the point is reached when
          even heating with a flame—so far as is
          consistent with safety—fails to reduce the
          vacuum, and again the tube is useless and
          must be sent to be re-exhausted.
          In using a spirit lamp, one precaution
          must be kept in mind; the alcohol will be
          ignited if it is brought near to the tube
          while the current is passing and an explo
          sion may occur. Again the vacuum may
          be lowered in other ways in tubes espe
          cially construe ted for this purnose. One of
          these ways is that described by Professor
          Crookes many years ago. To the tube is
          affixed a small extension tube containing
          a chemical salt, which upon being heated
          by llame from the outside, throws out
          more or less vapor.
          Or, as devised by Dr. Morton, an inside
          carbon filament having outside electrodes
          is mounted within the tube. Upon nassing
          current through the filament, beat ' is pro
          duced, vapor thrown out. and the- vacuum
          lowered. See Fig. 52a. In this manner a
          tube may be worked for a long time and
          the vacuum be adjusted according to cir
          cumstances.

          ters. Only a sensitive plate which can
          be bought of any dealer, and a suitable
          holder for the same are required. If you
          have no camera and no dark room, no

          this picture taken, stated that it changed entirely his diagnosis of the case, and
          that his operation would be entirely different from what he had intended.

          east by the X ray upon a fluorescent
          screen.
          All X ray pictures, whether taken
          with or without a camera or only seen
          OO the luminous screen of a fluoroscope.
          are not pictures of surfaces, but are.
          in reality, as has been said, shadow
          pictures. The X ray penetrates some
          substances more readily than others,
          just as clear glass is more transparent
          than paper is to sunlight. It is odd,
          however, that some of the substances
          most easily penetrated by the X rays
          are opaque to ordinary light. Professor
          Roentgen showed in his original an
          nouncement that aluminum is about
          200 times more transparent than plat
          inum to the X ray, yet both metals are
          opaque to sunlight. The X ray will
          penetrate flesh much more readily than
          bone. Therefore, if the hand is placed
          between the fluoroscope and the
          , Crookes tube and the X ray is projected
          through the hand. It will be seen by
          the fluoroscope that the bones cast
          irore shadow than the transparent
          flesh and stand out in bold relief.
          It will be interesting to note that car
          bon in any form—as diamond or as coal
          or graphite—is almost perfectly trans
          parent to the X ray. while lead is al
          most totally impenetrable by it.
          One of the greatest difficulties which
          will present itself to the experimenter
          is the choice of apparatus for the pro
          duction of the X ray effects. It must
          be confessed that pioneers in this field
          of research have made none too ex
          plicit statements as to their precise
          methods of operation.
          Roughly speaking, there may be said
          to be three general methods of opera
          tions involving the use of (1) influence
          or static electrical machines; (2) in
          duction coils, whose primary circuits
          are supplied either with continuous or
          alternating electrical currents; (.'?) Tes
          la transformers utilizing oscillatory
          electrical currents.
          INDUCTION COIL.
          Although the static machine may be
          used for the production of X ray effects,
          the induction coil is by far the most
          convenient form of apparatus for this
          purpose. By its use the more powerful
          X ray effects are obtained and the time
          of exposure lessened.
          The first thing the reader will want to
          know is the size of induction coil he will
          be called upon to purchase if he wishes
          to experiment. As regards this point
          he must be guided by the nature of the
          work he wishes to accomplish. If he is
          content with pictures of metallic objects
          Fig. 6.—This is a copy from an X-ray negative. taken by Dr. Morton, of a man
          who was shot by a maniac. The bullet is lodged in the man's chest. The subject Is
          now in the hospital to have the bullet removed.
          laid upon a plate-holder, of coins within
          a purse, or even with pictures of the
          hand (where a long exposure would be
          an object km) a coil capable of giving a.
          spark two inches in length will suffice.
          If, however, it is desired to obtain suc
          cessful pictures of Che hands, arms, feet
          and lower portions of the legs, a coil
          having a four-inch spark will be re
          quired. If, finally, he wishes to take a
          picture Of the shoulder, chest, abdomen,
          hip or thighs, it is essential that he have
          a coll with a spark length of eight or
          ten inches. As a summary of these re
          marks it may be said that for reasons
          which will presently appear in relation
          to the treatment of the Crookes tube, a
          coil giving an eight-inch spark will be
          found to answer all purposes above
          enumerated.
          This coil is a fundamental piece of
          apparatus, but there are a number of
          accessories which must now be consid-
          ered as necessary for an induction coil
          outfit. It must be decided whether di
          rect or alternating current sources shall
          be selected for the primary circuit. An
          opinion has already been expressed that
          the alternating current was not so ef
          fective as direct current when derived
          from a dynamo machine, but when bat
          ti-riea are used the chief inconvenience
          Fig. 3. showing the bone in a man's foot, taken through the boot. The outline o
          the flesh and leather is distinctly shown. Iron pegs and fasteners of the shoe an
          especially prominent, while the joints in the bones are very clear.
          in altering the direction of the primary
          current is the necessary use of a double
          break-wheel. It is therefore advised
          that the direct current be used in the
          primary circuit, interrupted by a break
          wheel.
          If the Edison current (supplied by a
          dynamo of 110 volts) be used with a
          vibrator, its platinum contact points
          will speedily be ruined. This will not
          happen if the source is a battery of a
          few primary or storage cells, as then
          the voltage is quite low. But batteries
          are quite expensive, and take up much
          room and need constant recharging and
          refilling.
          On the other hand, If a dynamo cur
          rent is used, we require a break w heel
          and blower run by electric or other
          motor, but escape all trouble from the
          batteries. The break wheel is a neces
          sity when high voltages are used, as it
          is useless to try to escape the destroy
          ing action of the dynamo current by
          cutting down its pressure with resist
          ances. There is no question but that
          batteries and vibrators can and will
          be extensively used, but the advan
          tages in the use of dynamo current are
          so great that its use is advised w hen it
          can be conveniently obtained. The kind
          of vibrators to use may saf dy be 1 ft
          with the instrument maker, but the best
          form of break wheel has already >■
          described. Not less essential than the
          use of a break wheel with high voltagi a
          is the use of a blower whose purpose
          it is to blow a stream of air at the
          spark which takes place on the break
          wheel when the circuit is broken. By
          many the condenser is considered am
          ply sufficient to cut down the sparking,
          and there is no doubt that the spark
          will be materially reduced, especially
          if a condenser is used w hose capacity
          may be regulated at will. Sufficient
          condenser capacity should be employed
          to practically "kill" the Sparking at
          the break wheel; the operator can
          readily determine, how much to use
          when he has a regular variable con-
          denser to control by watching the
          spark. On the whole, basing the opin
          ion on practical experience, it is almost
          impossible to get along without a blow
          er when dynamo currents are used. To
          demonstrate this in practical working,
          i? the supply of air is temporarily cut
          off from the break wheel, these things
          will occur: (1) A considerable length
          ening of the spark on the break w heel
          will appear: (2) a spark previously
          Fig. 28.
          The best breaker for the purpose is a
          wheel such as is shown iti Fig. 86. It is
          made of brass, with pieces of slate care
          fully fitted into its circumference, so that
          when the wheel is made to revolve by an
          electric motor, or other motive power, the
          fixed brush A will first rest on a brass pro
          jection and then on the exposed section of
          the insulating slate. The fixed brush I?
          always makes contact on the hub of the
          wheel. The slate being of the form shown
          and carefully fitted, will wear indefinitely
          and cannot fly out. The "makes" are a
          trifle longer than the "breaks," or, in
          other words, the exposed sections of brass
          are a little longer than the sections of the
          slate.
          With such large primary currents it is
          not only necessary to connect a condenser
          around the break-wheel as was don,' with
          the circuit-breaker B in Fig. 24. but it is
          also desirable to have an air-blast directed
          at the sparking point on the wheel so as
          to keep down the spark as shown at C in
          Fig. 2>>. This break-wheel was one of
          many results of a long course of experi
          mentation leading to the X ray work done
          by Dr. Morton, and is likely to become a
          standard article. In its present form it
          was invented and is now made by H. 10.

          with the production of X rays, because the
          smaller or "cleaner" the spark at the cir
          cuit-breaker in the primary circuit, the
          tiner will be the effects produced.
          just able to pass between the discharg
          ing rods on the induction coil will cease
          to pass; (3) the vacuum tube heats up
          more rapidly; and (4) the most import
          ant of all, the actual production of X
          rays in the Crookes tube notably di
          minishes. It would appear, therefore,
          that both a condenser and a blower
          should be used to produce the best X
          ray work with high voltage current in
          the primary.
          The only other necessary apparatus
          required in this connection are the
          proper rheostats to govern the current
          respectively supplied to the primary of
          the induction coil, the motor which
          drives the break wheel and the motor
          which drives the blower.
          The connection between the different
          devices will be readily seen from an
          examination of the diagram given in
          Fig. 4.
          It only remains to be said that the
          break wheel in the combination of ap
          paratus here described has eight
          breaks, and is made to revolve 6,000
          times per minute, so that there are
          makes and breaks each minute."</text>

        <text>THE LATEST PHASES OF X-RAY INVESTIGATION
          Why the Mysterious Radiance Is Visible to
          Some Blind People
          Instead of diminishing as the days go by ;
          interest in the X ray is constantly on the
          increase and any new theory as to its ori
          gin, action or results is eagerly seized upon
          by medical men, electricians and the pub
          lic in general, ln some way the X ray has
          not proved all that was expected a year
          ago, but in others it has surpassed the
          wildest conjectures as to its possibilities.
          It has been shown that it 13 not a play
          thing to be used by anybody, and it has
          also been demonstrated that in experi
          enced hands its field is almost boundless.
          Ever since Professor Roentgen made
          the discovery oi the existence of the X ray
          scientific men have constantly been expe
          rimenting to ascertain why the wonderful
          rauiance is invisible to a normal oye.
          Powerful enough to pass with ease through
          a piece of three-inch oak the human eye
          cannot see it While it is shown that a
          space of many cubic feet around an active
          Crookes tube must be a perfect glow of
          light, as far as the human eye is concerned
          it is perfect darkness. Truly this is mys
          terious.
          For a long time the generally accepted
          theory was that the vibrations of the X
          rays were too rapid for the human sense
          of vision to grasp. It was estimated that
          this was a trillion times the vibration of
          ordinary whita in daylight. Then came
          the astonishing statement that many blind
          people experienced the sensation of light
          on looking at a working Crookes tuba. To
          be sure they saw no objects, but the fact
          that they were able to distinguish light
          was something wonderful.
          Charles Guillaume, an eminent scientist ;
          of France, has just issued a circular in re- ;
          gard to tbis aspect of the X ray that seems ;
          reasonable in many ways. Experiments ;
          have also been made in this City that show I
          the correctness of his reasoning. A copy |
          of the circular in question has been re- •
          ceived by Professor Van der _aillen of the ]
          School of Engineering, and he has only
          been too willing to show it to those inter
          ested.
          In Lis circulars Guillaume states that
          he was led to his investigations by the
          acknowledged connection between the X
          ray and the ultra v.olet rays of the
          spectrum. it has been shown photo
          graphically that the ultra violet rays ex
          ist, and yet they cannot be seen by the
          human eye. Whether they are also capa
          ble oi penetrating solids is still a matter
          of conjecture, owing to the lack of appa
          ratus fur collecting and separating them
          from the other colors of the spectrum.
          Following up his theory, Guillaume
          concluded that there was something in
          the normal eye tbat resisted the X rays
          and prevented their reaching the nerve
          centers. The aqueous humor and crys
          talline tense of the eye are as transparent
          to ordinary light as the finest window
          glass, but investigations show them to be
          as impervious to the X ray as a piece of
          lead. This is why tne rays cannot be
          seen.
          In many cases of blindness, particularly
          blindness caused by some accident, the
          optic nerve is in perfect condition, but the
          structure of the eyeball has changed. The
          greater portion of it has decayed and
          become, instead of a perfect piece of
          mechanism and an arrangement of refrac
          tory atom-, merely a piece of organic
          matter like the tissue in many o;her parts
          of the body. In this condition it is plainly ]
          A. P. Crittenden, who
          ' seen that it will offer no more resistance
          to the X ray than a portion of skin, ana
          that if the nerves are still perfect, the
          rays will reach them and the sensation of
          light be conveyed to the brain.
          To ascertain the correctness of Guil
          laume's theory several experiments were
          made for Tue Call on both normal and
          blind eyes. Professor Van der Naillen
          Kindly loaned his apparatus for this pur
          pose, and the results have been more than
          enough to show that Guillaume is on the
          right tracK at least. What the future will
          develop remains to be seen.
          For these experiments the eyeballs of
          different domestic animals were used,
          most of them being obtained in Butcher
          town as soon as the killing was done.
          There was the greatest uniformity of re
          sult observable in ail the tests.
          In the first experiment the naturally
          blind eye of a calf and also a normal eye
          of the same animal were placed side by
          side on the same plate and given exactly
          the same. time of exposure. They were of
          course developed at the same time and
          printed on the same sheet of paper.
          The proof showed the normal eye simply
          as a dark spot, with a slight indication of
          1 the crystalline lens appearing a little
          ', darker than the other parts. The conclu-
          I sion to be reached from this is that the
          rays could not pass through the "eye. Tbe
          biind eye, on the contrary, freely per
          mitted the passage of the X rays and ap
          peared quite light, with considerable dn
          lerentiation of the layers. Tnere was a
          slight indication of the lens and also sev
          eral spots that were meaningless. But the
          difference between the two eyes was ap
          parent at a glance.
          Experiments were also made with the
          eyes of sheep and rabbits and the results
          were about the same in all cases. The
          normal eyes came out perfectly black in
          all instances, but the blind eyes showed
          different comparative shades, owing, of
          course, to the condition of the tissues.
          Experiments were also made with eyes
          artificially blinded. From some the lens
          was removed and others were injected

          On the whole the results of these tests
          were similar to the others. The normal
          eyes showed dark and the artificially
          blinded eyes permitted the passace of the
          rays in spots, possibly such spots as were
          acted on by the injected chemicals. The

          removal of the lens was clearly shown,
          although the aqueous humor that re
          mained showed as a dark plane.
          The eyes of sheep and rabbits did not
          give as good radiographs as those of
          calves and sheep," for the reason that they
          were much smaller and the differentiation
          was not as plainly indicated. Still, in
          every instance the results showed that
          the X rays passed through the blind eyes,
          more or less, but were resisted almost
          entirely by the healthy eyes.
          "But what use is all this?" some might
          ask. The answer is, possibly a great deal
          and possibly none* It may be very useful
          at opening up new fields in the study of
          radiation which will be of great use in the
          future. It may be all wrong and can only
          be put down as so much timo wasted in
          the study of science. -yi-y
          But it would seem as if it would be use
          ful in determining the extent of an
          afllieted person's blindness. It has been
          demonstrated from time to time that per
          sons who have lost the sight of an eye
          through some accident have nearly al
          ways been able to sco the X raj*. This
          would prove that the nerves were not in
          jured, and that if the eye could be re
          paired sight would be restored.
          Cases of people blinded from other
          causes might be tested if the physician
          could determine the condition of the eye
          ball. Should he be able to ascertain that
          it was in a condition to allow the X rays
          to pass through it, and the person still he

          A Possibility That the Rays May Be Ex
          amples of Universal Force
          About one year ago the scientific and
          unscientific world was startled by an an
          nouncement that a professor in the uni
          versity at Wurzburp, Germany, had dis
          covered a means whereby the hidden in
          | terior of the human frame might be ren
          dered visible. Professor Wilhelm Konrad
          j Roentgen, while engaged in electrical ex
          ; periments, discovered that certain "rays"
          ; penetrated opaque bodies and produced
          J effjets analogous to those produced by
          j rays of light upon a sensitive photograph
          i plate, although the plate was inclosed in
          1 a plate-holder. In other words a perfect
          | outline picture was produced without cx
          i posure to light. *yA\
          Unable at the time to definitely deter
          mine the chemical, mechanical or other
          attributes of the rays, the term X was
          given them, X standing for an unknown
          quantity. Since their discovery a great
          many people have satisfied their curiosity
          regarding the rays, and have learned that
          it is quite easy by the employment of the
          ray to produce a photograph of the bony
          structure of the body, or of coins, etc.,
          hidden within a box or purse. The flesh
          of the body and the substance of the box
          or purse offer no impediment to the pas
          sage of the X raj-.
          These remarkable happenings, involv
          ing a sudden setting aside of all previous
          conceptions of the limit and power of
          human vision, however artificially aided,
          were sufficient to confer upon the newly
          found power a reputation bordering on
          the miraculous, and it is not improbable
          that many people believe that with the
          use of the X ray it i 3 possible to see for
          long distances through walls of bouses
          without number. It is to assist in creat
          ing a proper idea of what the new dis
          covery really is, what it is capable of
          doing, and to what extent the knowledge
          of its qualities and abilities may modify
          our present conception of natural physics
          that this article is presented.
          All forces of powers are termed energy.
          The science of physics uses the term "ra
          diant energy" as meaning energy pro
          ceeding outward from a source and pro
          ducing effects at some distant point. The
          energy may be transmitted by its actual
          transfer to the distant point of matter, as
          the flight of a bullet from a gun; or it
          may propagate itself along a line by the
          motion of the particles of the media
          through which it operates. If you lay a
          number of marbles in a row, touching
          each other, and then strike one end of the
          row the marble at the distant end will
          move away. All the marbles intermedi
          ate between the one struck and the one
          moved will show no movement. Each
          one transfers the energy it receives to the
          next one, no one undergoing mere than
          very slight displacement. This is the
          movement of ordinary lieht ''wave mo
          tions." The former, represented by the
          flight of the bullet, is that of the X ray.
          The X ray is ptod tied by the employ
          ment of a glass globe from which the air
          is almost but not quite exhausted. Two
          wires enter the globe through its glass
          sides. One of the wires terminates inside
          the globe in a small concave disk ; the other
          wire has on its end, within the globe, a
          small platinum plate set at an ancle of
          forty-five degrees. A current of electricity
          of very high frequency and potentiality,
          obtained either from the secondary wire
          of a powerful induction coil, or from a
          static machine, is sent through the glass
          globe, the anode terminator being
          attached 10 the wire having tho pla
          tinum plate, and the cathode to
          the other, and while the current passes
          there is thrown off from the platinum
          plate what is known as the X ray. Al
          most every schoolboy is familiar with the
          fact that if a wire carrying a current be
          broken a spark will occur at the break.
          For convenience in distinguishing tho ter
          minals of an electric circuit, the end giving
          off a negative current is called the cathode
          and the positive the anode.
          In the operation of the arc light it is
          found that the anode carbon forms a cup
          like depression on its end and is decom
          posed more rapidly than is the cathode,
          showing that a stream of force pastes
          from the cathode. Hence in experiments
          upon electrical emanations, especially in
          •S.mplf farm of Focus Tube.
          Imhroved -form of Focu.l Tube.
          vacuum tubes where the energy becomes
          luminous, the cathode ray is the impor
          tant one. The X rays are radiant ener
          gy. They are possessed of a singular di
          rectness of purpose. m they cannot be di
          verted or turned from their path, refracted
          nor reflected, ns may be rays of heat and
          light and sound. They are not the cath
          ode rays reflected from the platinum
          plate, for the cathode rays pass completely
          over to the anode terminator to form the
          circuit. They induce chemical action in
          certain classes of matter, as a photographic
          plate. They cause fluorescence when they
          fall upon certain substances; that is, the
          substance"* plow with light when the "X"
          rays strike them. The rays are propa
          gated in straight, direct lines, and are not
          susceptible of polarization, as are those of
          lieht. They discharge all bodies either
          positively or negatively electrified, the
          former more rapidly than the latter.
          The immediate results, the application
          of the discovery to the needs of surgery,
          naturally receive * greatest popular atten
          tion, for a most wonderful knowledge has
          suddenly been bestowed upon the practi
          tioner. Not only foreign substances, as
          was shot and killed by Mrs. Laura D. Fair on the ferry-bo*
          El Capitan in November, 1874, and his law partner, Samuel W.
          Inge, the first United States Attorney for this district. Judge
          A. Glassell, who is now passing his declining days in afflu
          ence at Los Angeles, also practiced law in the Naglee building.
          On the second floor Dr. Hugh H. Toland, the well-known
          surgeon, also had apartments frora 1850 to the day of his death,
          some fifteen years ago. The owners of the present building,
          the sole tenant of which is now a printer, intend fitting up the
          interior of the structure to harmonize with modern times.
          Already the old iron railings which pro
          jected from the windows on Merchant
          street, reminders of pioneer architecture
          have been ruthlessly torn from their fasten
          ings and consigned to the junk heap. The
          bricks in this old building were well made
          and laid in a good bed of cement and mor
          tar, as is evidenced by their lasting quali
          ties at this day. It cost Captain Naglee
          $140 per thousand to lay the brick and the
          fcrtisans employed by him— carpenters, masons, etc. — received
          from $15 to $20 a day, according to their skill.
          A Remarkable |JeWspaper.
          Mr. Edward Randlett of Alameda has in his possession a
          relic of the Revolutionary days which he holds more valuable
          than money. It consists of a copy of a newspaper prinied*27
          years ago. The paper was the seven hundred and ssventy
          ' ninth number of the Boston Gazette and County Journal. 'its
          editorial page announcements remark that it contains "the
          fresheft advices, Foreign and Domeftic.'*
          and bears the date of Monday, March 12,
          1770. It is a four-page paper about -0x24
          inches when open. It was the first issue
          after the Boston massacre, which occurred
          the previous week after the paper went to
          press. This subject is given two columns,
          including naif a column of explanations.
          Edward and Francis Archbald, William
          Jj:jJ , Merchant and John Leech Jr. are given the
          credit of bringing on the conflict, which occurred shortly after
          9 o'clock at night. ■ "*:^ Ijy'J^JJJy..
          Among the most notable features of this ancient paper as
          compared with the papers of to-day is the lack of headlines and
          the editorials in the first column ot the front page. Not a head
          line appears in the whole issue. Reports of a meeting of free
          holders of the town of Roxbury is given. It was called "to
          know the minds of the Town, whether they will do anything to
          ftrengthen the hands of the Merchants in their Non-Importa
          tion agreement."
          The advertisements are unique as wel
          as ludicrous. One, Smith offers a reward
          for money lost between his residence and
          the residence of Widow So-and-So, detail
          ing the hours between whicli it was lost.
          The legal ads would be the laughing stock
          t' ; of tho followers of Blackstone to-day.
          It is said that the only other copy of
          this piper is in the Smithsonian Institu
          tion, Washington, D. C.
          There is a. lady in Augusta who has never heen from
          under tne old Confederate flag. Her name is known, but by
          request it is Withheld. Whether walking, eating .or -sleeping,
          there i- always a Confederate flag over her head. While walk
          ing on the streets there is always a fleg in her hat, and, no mat
          ter how many hats or bonnets. she has, there is always to be
          found a flag pinned on the inside of the crown. On the head
          post of her bed is securely fastened a large "flag of the Con
          federate States. The flag is as necessary for her as three meals
          J; a day. * She says she has never surrendered and never. wilL
          bullets, needles, etc., in the human body,
          are accurately located. Out the healthful
          or unhealthful condition of the internal
          organs may be discerned and determined
          by the use of the X ray. If nothing
          else had resulted from Professor Roent
          gen's discovery, this alone must place It
          in the front rank of valuable acquisitions.
          Bnt it is the further fact that much of the
          action of the ray is bounded by totally un
          known law, which arouse speculative in
          quiry among scientists.
          The question is. What bearing has the
          newly discovered physical manifestation
          on our preconceived notions of the phy
          sical universe? It is one that awakens
          profound contemplation among students
          of the sciences.
          What are these rays? They originate at
          that point on the platinum plate where
          it is bombarded by the cathode ray. They
          are in some . respects electrical in char
          acter and in others not. They seem to
          follow some of the known laws governing
          light, and again disregard them.
          There is an increasing tendency among
          investigators to assert that the primal
          cause of physical manifestation, the
          universal force, is some form of electrical
          energy. What is termed space, the space
          between the planets, is said to be filled
          with ether, but just what ether is no one
          seems to know. Some say it is matter;
          others say it is not. Phenomena occur in
          the ether, light is transmitted throngh it,
          perhaps formed in it; electric and mag
          netic phenomena, attraction and repul-»
          sion have their field of action in it.
          The X ray is the product of electrical
          energy and is manifest only in vacua ap
          proacning that of spac-*, and its force in
          creases with the reduction of temperature.
          In many things it exhibits fts greatest
          powers under conditions which approach
          the conceived idea of interplanetary
          space. Did Roentgen discover a means of.
          making actual exhibition of the universal
          force? May it not lead to the positive de
          termination of the vexed question as to
          the character of the ether? Common air
          consists of two gases oppositely electrified,
          which if decomposed would expand enor
          mously. The single fact of the X ray's
          ability to discharge electrified bodies is
          pregnant with meaning, for, by its opera
          tion along this line it may be found possi
          ble to utilize such action in the generation
          of dynamic ener.-y to wort machinery.
          It may be possible to employ some modi
          fied application of the X ray to disrupt
          the molecular bonds of the gases, and
          then power will become unlimited."</text>

        <text>EDISON IS FAILING.
          Great Scientist in Constant Fear of
          Cancer of the Stomach.
          "I am feeling poorly — very poorly.
          The old X-ray trouble is after me. It
          won't let go. It killed my assistant.
          Yes, sir; killed him by inches. Now
          it's after me. Knots all along my stom

          Old Father Time will have to diagnose
          it I guess."
          It was a gray-haired and seemingly
          palsied man who spoke thus, says the
          Chicago Inter Ocean. The world calls
          him Thomas A. Edison, the greatest in
          ventor that history has ever known.
          He is spending" his time nowadays in
          a weather-beaten house called "The
          Monastery," three miles outside the vil
          lage of Stewartville, N. J. The vener-
          TIIOVIAS A. EDISON.
          able shack get« its odd name from the
          fact that no women are allowed there.
          The X-ray ailment developed several
          years ago while Edison was experi
          menting with the Roentgen rays. He it
          was who perfected the fluoroscope. An
          assistant named Dalley helped him in
          his work. Dalley had his face near the
          X-ray. Edison had the strange light
          near his stomach. Dalley developed a
          cancer on his face. It killed him a
          month ago. Edison is now In constant
          fear of a cancer in his stomach. That
          is why he had to give up his X-ray ex
          periments.
          Partly for recreation he began visit
          ing "The Monastery" to work on a
          new invention in cement. And in this
          he is now engrossed. He retires at 3
          o'clock In the morning and rises at 0
          a. ra. The rest of the day is spent in
          work or "day dreaming." There is
          something weird about these "dream
          ing spells." For hours he sits iv a
          chair, his massive head buried in his
          breast, his hands clasped together,
          and his thumbs twitching convulsively.
          No one can rouse him at these times.
          Birds hop at his feet and perch upon
          his shoulder. Caterpillars drop from
          the trees and go on exploring expedi
          tions through hit shabby clothes —
          through the shabby clothes of a man
          whose vtjalth is placed at a low esti
          mate at $4,000,000. Always when he
          emerges from his "dreams" he has
          some fresh idea, some new plan to pur
          sue.
          The people in Stewartsvllle love and
          fear this wonderfully* weird man. He
          has changed greatly, they say. In only
          one respect, declare the knowing ones,
          is he the Tom Edison of former years
          —he can and does still swear volum
          inously and with great art when hin

          AM. because of a peculiarly un
          yielding gray metal It has be
          ivmc possible to make a de
          velopment of revolutionary
          character In the newest form of X-ray
          apparatus. The discovery Is the result
          C'l the perseverance of Dr. William
          David Coolldge and his associates of the
          ri-M'.-iroh laboratory of the General Klec
          11 it Company. Radiographers and radio
          therapists decluru this development of
          tlic X-ray tube to be the greatest dis
          covery In the art since Prof. WUhclm
          Kuiir.nl Roentgen In 1893 startled the
          win hi with his original announcement
          of an Invisible beam that could pene
          trate npaiiuc bodies and make shadow
          praphs of hidden objects.
          The metal In question is commonly
          known us tungsten, but It might better
          t'O railed wolfram the wilful, as this Is
          the older name for It and the adjective
          attached quite fittingly characterizes the
          material. Dr. Coolldge'H X-ray tube is
          almost directly the consequence of ex
          haustive efforts made to adapt tungsten
          fur service as a filament for Incan
          descent electric lights. He was not a
          pioneer In this direction, for two Aus
          trian. Mjessrs. Just and Ilanaman, had
          preceded him.
          These Ingenious Viennese made fila
          ments out of the seemingly Intractable
          metal by binding particles of tungsten
          or tungsten oxide with an amalgam
          which could be worked into wlrcllke
          form and then subjected to Intense heat
          in a vacuum. In this manner the ele
          ments of the amalgam were burned
          em unci the tungsten particles became
          tnlMHled as' a filament. The light It
          furnished was much more brilliant than
          that of the curlion filament; consumed
          far less current a candle- power, but
          was so brittle that Us life was a short
          one.
          Too much was at stajte not to Justify
          a deal of painstaking experimenting,
          and accordingly the research laboratory
          at Schenectady set Itself the task of
          evolving a form of ductile tungsten.
          Finally success was attained and n per
          fectly pliable, ductile wire was produced,
          as strong ns steel, which could be drawn
          to halrlike diameters and yet possess
          extraordinary strength. This was about
          four years ago.
          Trior to this the Roentgen tube was
          limited in Its possibilities by the en
          durance of platinum, which was used
          for the target, or antlcathode, of tho
          X-ray apparatus; limited because this
          tnrget has to withstand Intense heat to
          give off the most effective measure of
          deeply penetrative rays, and the melting
          point of platinum Is 3,195 degrees
          Fahrenheit. The only way to Improvo
          the X-ray output seemed to be to tind
          a more refractory material for tho
          target, one that had a higher melting
          point.
          Until the advent of pure malleable
          tungsten there was nothing to supplant
          the platinum, but then the situation
          was changed. Tungsten has a melting
          point nearly 60 per cent, higher than
          platinum, or, to be exact, 5,432 degrees
          Fahrenheit. To this extent the substi
          tution of tungsten extended tho possi
          bilities of the Itoentgen tube.
          From tho cathode or negative element
          of the X-ray tube cathode rays are
          driven forth to strike the interixisod tar
          get or antlcathode. The more violently
          they are Impelled against the target the
          stronger the resulting X-rays coming
          from the antlcathode. But, unfortu
          nately, this produces heat, and if the
          attack Is too Impetuous or strong the
          metal of the target may be raised to the
          melting point and scattered against the
          Inner walls of the glass lube. Therefore
          by substituting the more resistant tung
          sten a very material gain was secured
          and more powerful X-rays were placed
          within the reach of the radiographer,
          the man of science and the radlo-thcra-plat.
          Remember, until radium was discov
          ered and physicians found uses for it the
          Itoentgen tube was looked upon as a
          remedial agent. In fact, the X-ray appa
          ratus has done some wonderful things In
          battling with various diseases and it
          has been used effectively In the treat
          ment of skin diseases, malignant growths,
          sciatica, rheumatism, tuberculosis and
          cancer. Hut unfortunately the control
          of the X-ray hns been an extremely diffi
          cult matter, and this. In large measure,
          has been duo to the very Instability or
          uncertainty In the strength of the rays
          employed.
          As one authority has said: "What Is
          needed Is m more exact means of defini
          tion of what we ure really using In a
          given case. This necessity will
          be more evident when we reflect how
          small an Interval divides the beneficial
          from the noxious dose of X-rays. Irri
          tation and exuberant growth may be
          produced by a dose of X-rays only

          the Apparatus

          paralyze and kill, and this Irritative
          growth Is the very sign and symbol of
          malignancy. In a deep seated tumor the
          surface growth may be inhibited, while
          the d:eper layers are stimulated by the
          same irradiation."
          Apparently strength Is needed, but
          strength that can be administered with
          the nicest discrimination. Now we shall
          begin to understand better what Dr.
          Coolldge has produced.
          First, however, It is necessary to un
          derstand how the ordinary Roentgen tube
          works. Tho electric current enters the
          tube at the electrode, which Is called
          the anode, and ends Its course at the
          negative electrode, termed the cathode.
          When the current flows through the
          tube, peculiar rays occur at tho latter
          point, and these are known as cathode
          rays. They stream directly against the
          path of the exciting positive Ions, which
          are thrown off by the nnode and which
          actually Induce the cathode rays by this
          bombardment of the cathode.
          The cathode rays Impinge upon the
          Interposed target, or antlcathode ns It
          Is so frequently called. The higher the
          vacuum In the tubo the greater the
          speed of the electrons or cathode rays,
          bee ause there are fewer molecules of gas
          to Interrupt the flight of the electrons.
          Accordingly, tho greater the speed of
          the cathode raj's the more penetrating
          the resulting X-rays emanating from
          the target.
          To put It In another way, whenevei n
          rapidly moving electron comes In con
          tact with a material body, a concussion
          occurs in the surrounding ether analo
          gous to that which is caused when n
          bullet hits nn object, and splinters from
          the opposing mass, In their turn, set the

          rections from the face of a Roentgen
          tule target are X-rays.
          Roentgen therapy rests on the ability
          of these X-rays to change the living cell,
          sometimes even killing the cell Just us
          sunlight does. Hut while the sunlight af
          fects principally, only the surface of the
          body, the X-rays exert nn Influence on
          tissues lying deeper. Just how this
          metamorphosis Is brought about is not
          yet known, but apparently diseased cells
          ure made to purge themselves or to dis
          solve ami pass uway Into the circula
          tion. We can not go Into all of the technical
          niceties by which Dr. Coolldge evolved
          his present apparatus. In a great meas
          ure his discoveries came about while
          studying how to Improve the antl
          cathode or tnrget of the ordinary com
          mercial X-ray tube. In order to deter
          mine the ultimate resistance of this part
          of the apparatus his experiments were
          cnrrled to tho point of the ruin or the
          destruction of the target.
          In thus learning practically how
          much energy was required to destroy
          the target he. learned some things that
          might otherwise not have come within
          his ken. Having thus evolved u satis
          factory tungsten target he set himself
          the task of getting rid of some of tho
          other limitations peculiar to the X-ray
          tube of the usual type. Strange to say,
          In doing this he found ways to upset
          previously accepted theories, and In the
          end discovered how he could perfect a
          far more powerful Roentgen tube a
          tube that works as no other X-ray tubo
          has before. At the same time he Inci
          dentally evolved Increased facility of
          control.
          Remember, we started out with the
          substitution of n tungsten target In
          place of the previously prevailing plat
          inum antlcathode. Well, It was not
          long after this change was made that
          Dr. Coolldge saw that tho usual massive
          aluminum cathode was apt to melt
          when the tube was working with a very
          heavy discharge. In fact, molten glob
          ules of the cathode were hurled against
          the glass of the tube. When resulting
          in nothing worse this injury to the
          cathode changed the focal spot ot the
          electrons, and this In turn hurt tho re
          sulting X-rays, upset their control, and
          when used for making shadowgraphs
          caused the picture to be blurred and
          unsatisfactory.
          It then occurred to Dr. Coolldge to
          displace tho aluminum cathode by em
          ploying one made of tungsten, taking
          advantage of the higher melting point
          of the latter, which is four and a half
          times greater than that of aluminum.
          Rut trouble began ns soon as curient
          was passed Into the tube, for the be
          havior of the appuratus was distinctly
          cranky, or Uko the ordinary outfit when
          working badly.
          However, by passing current through
          only for a very brief while, then cutting
          it off, then turning it on again, gradu
          ally the functioning steadied until the
          tube would wotk continuously and well
          for several minutes.
          Dr. Irving I.angmulr, also of the re
          search laboratory staff, had found that
          n hot tungsten cathode In n very high
          vacuum, much higher than that or
          dnlarlly employed In a Roentgen ray
          tube, could be made to yield continuously
          a supply of electrons, and this supply was
          regulated entirely by tho temperature.
          Here was the germ of a revolutionary
          procedure, for It meant that the elec
          trons hurled from the cathode were not
          to depend upon the inducing attack ol
          bombarding positive ions from the
          anode, but would be Inspired by the
          temperature of tho cathode, and thli
          by a suitable control of current could
          be regulated to a nicety, ranging from
          3,434 to 4,60! degrees Fahrenheit.
          The usual X-ray tube has a vacuum
          of a few microns, but In th case of the
          Coolldge apparatus this Is reduced tr
          not more than a few hundredths of a
          micron, and at this extremely low pres
          sure there arc not enough molecules ot
          gas available to provide transport for
          the electrical charge, even though the
          pressure of the current reach the great
          potential of 100.000 volts, but when
          the cathode Is heated all this Is changed,
          and from It pours a stream of pure
          electronic discharge.</text>

          X-Ray DISEASE
          In EARLY Stage
          EPITHELIOMA, the dread and curse of
          the Roentgenologist, has been found,
          in its early stages, amenable to
          radium cure, so that a distinct step in the
          advancement of Roentgen-ray science has
          been achieved. Epithelioma is skin can
          cer caused by the X-ray and has been the
          cause of the loss of fingers, hands and
          even the lives of Roentgen-ray experts.
          At a recent meeting of the British Med
          ical Association, the Roentgenologist sec
          tion was notable for the large number of
          disfigured hands, arms and faces. In some
          cases epithelioma has spread to the chin
          and chest. Skin grafting, freezing and
          other desperate measures have been used
          in vain to arrest the course of the dread
          disease.
          It Is now firmly established, however,
          that radium rays will cure the malady in
          Its early stages and relief has been ob
          tained, even when the disease had ran a
          couple of years Tho effect of radium on
          long standing cancers, however, is nil.
          It seems almost a paradox of radiology
          that the accepted use of a heavy gamma
          radiation from a Roentgen tube will cause
          a diseased condition of the skin, wbicn a
          similar radiation from a tube of radium
          will cure The output of the Roentgen-ray
          tube is almost wholly composed of hard,
          penetrating, irritating gamma rays. The
          radium discharges the beta ray in great
          quantity, as well as the gamma ray. It is
          the beta ray that has been proved beyond
          question to be the efficient curatie power,
          and it is only the secondary betas gen
          erated by the gamma when striking any
          resisting substances, that gives it its value
          in the Roentgen-ray tube work. Hence, a
          surface lesion of morbid cell growth, be
          It hyperkeratosis or basal cell, is cured by
          tho large output of soft beta radiation of
          radium.
          It is not possible that. If it were pos
          sible to gauge the output of the Roentgen
          rav tube in power enough to generate the
          curative beta rays by impact on the su
          perficial disease, it could be cured, as
          well as by radium, but in so doing it
          would be necessarv to discharge energy
          enough of the hard gamma variety to be
          highly injurious to the deeper tissue of
          the vessels, muscle and skeleton.</text>

          Ml HUB than a year ago Ir How.
          art A. Kelly, the noted sur
          geon if the Jo Hopkins
          Hospital of Baltimore, as
          serted that the X-ruy apparatus
          would pn iiahiy mpplMI radium In
          the treatment if certain disease?. At
          that time lr. Kelly had achieved
          throng i the agency of radium cures
          that the - alpel could not effect, hut
          despite hie enthusiasm that eminent
          specialist freely proclaimed greater
          possiblUlles for the Itocntgcn tube
          when perfected.
          About the .same limn Dr. Kelly ex
          plained to h 'ongresslonal committee
          JJuet how radium probably wrought
          Its marvellous cures. He .mid: "Kiidlum
          goes further than surgery, an e
          surgery only treats that which la visi
          ble, and the jur : on Is under the con
          stant Impulse and desire to tave the
          face of the patient. He does not want
          to mutilate the patient, and so he
          thinks that taking out Just so much
          will do. He falls, and there Is a recur
          rence. Hut the radium, like the blessed
          light from heaven above, bathes the
          part throws Its gamma rays, which
          are Its active rays. Into the part,
          Ctlng on all the myriad microscopic
          cells, not only the manifest, gross,
          surgical lesions, hut all those little
          cells through the surrounding tissues,
          and it acts like millions of microscopic
          knives to destroy them, or like a lash
          to drive them hack. In other words,
          radium will not only do what surgery
          does, but it goc beyond and takes a
          class of cases which arc utterly be
          yond surgery."
          Hut the manipulation or control of
          this radioactive substance has well
          defined limits, and for . ertaln Internal
          applications this curative medium has
          not leen successfully employed for
          that reason. As Dr. Kelly expressed
          It, an X-ray tube Misccptthle of nice
          control will make It possible to deal
          with abdominal cancer, to cover a
          larger area needing this method of
          sm.i k and. at the same time, will
          afford cheaper treatment for the suf
          fering multitude. Until recently, how
          ever, the X-ray was something of a
          te'o edged weaiain In the assault upon
          disease: the patient wa likely to be
          burned while undergoing; exposure to
          tlte penetrating rays, and the oiera
          tor, to safeguard himself, had to stand
          behind a metal screen and watch his
          subject from afar through a lead glass
          panel.
          When "burns" are spoken of In con
          nection with the X-ray they should
          not be confused with superficial burns
          due to excessive heat. The X-ray burn
          manifests itself slowly and sometimes
          only after many days, because the In
          Jury is fairly decpsented. the tissues
          re destroyed by th t chemical effects
          of the piercing rays and the patient
          does not feel the hurt instantly as he
          would if subjected to a painfully hot
          body. Indeed, these actinic burns are
          apt to be malignant in their character
          and very stubborn in their persistence
          Now the patient la I sirs of a New
          Yorker have discovered and appar
          ently pwtlCted a hurnksa X-ray that
          retains all of the beneficial qualities
          While free from baneful ones.
          Charles H. Stanley belle VM he has
          evolved a burnless or harmless X-ray,
          or, to be more exact, produced an ap
          paratus by which he can generate
          X-rays that will not injure bodily tis
          sues, but at the same time WM do the
          corrective work of the gamma rays of
          radium, described by Dr. Kelly, This
          Invention, he believes, will work thera
          peutic wonders, and if BO It unques
          tionably marks one of the big ad
          vances Of science in its tireless battle
          with disease. Mr. Stanley is not a
          physician, but his electrical researches
          KN been inspired alone by n desire to
          wse that agency for the relief of suf
          ferers. Fourteen yean ago be began his ex
          periments. He believed cancer could

          tory expressed a desire to have the
          bones of the famous horse for exhibi
          tion in the museum. The late John
          H. Wallace, founder of the American
          Reoiater. offered to defray the ex
          penses of removing Hambletonian's
          remains from their burial place at
          Cheater, N. Y., to the museum, making
          the proposition through Guy Miller
          of Chester, the first man who ever
          drew a rein over the horse, who was
          authorised to arrange with the two
          remaining heirs to the Rysdyk estate
          tar the removal. One of the heirs re
          fused to consent to the disturbing of
          the remains and the negotiations came
          to an end.
          Hamhlet i.i. in was buried on high
          ground on the Rysdyk place at Ches

          out to tourists as one of the noted
          eights along the route, Became of
          that fact the monument that now
          commemorates the "old horse'' a

          the greatest trotting sire thai ever

          usually high frequencies, but unhap
          pily his apparatus lacked the neces
          sary feature of control. From a labora
          tory Milnt of view he had something
          of extreme interest then, indeed so
          spectacular that it was used later for
          exhibition purposes, but that was not
          Mr. Stanley's goal.
          It Is not of present interest to de
          scrilie how he overcame technical ob
          stacles one nfter another by tlrel ssly

          Indeed tes" alternations are of such
          ama.ing rapidity that the needle of
          the meter is apparently at stand
          still. In other words, the changing
          impulses in the circuit follow- one an
          other with such velocity that the cur
          rent Is nearly a direct tie. How Is
          this accomplished?

          he asserts that the results are in

          called "soft" rays lacked the vigor

          Mr. Howland withdrew the offer of

          reeled where it is to-day.

          An Inscription on the bas8 of the
          monument reads:
          "Born May 6, 1848. Died March 25,
          1876.".
          BelOW this Is a blank space which
          shows that at some time something
          Inscribed there had been chiselled
          away. That elimination has always
          excited the curiosity of strangerH vis
          iting the spot, but no one has ever
          seemed able or willing to answer their
          queries regarding It, and only here
          and there Is one in Chester who recalls
          now what the Inscription wns. It read
          thus:
          "His greatness was the act of In
          herited power."
          The vagueness of its phrasing and
          Its application were so much criticised
          thai the National Association of Trot
          ting Horse Breeders ordered It cut
          away, and It was. On a panel he
          neath the blank space is the word:
          "Hambletonian," NO one of the name
          of Ryadyki or of an heir to the
          Ryedyk fortune that Hambletonian
          founded, had aught to do with Ihe
          placing of this monument to the mar
          vellous old horse.
          The agitation for the removal of the
          monument to a more public place in

          A friend asked him on cue of the

          fill the mind With longings for arctic

          sibly His can be better understood
          by giving verbatim Mr. Stanley's ex-
          planatlon Of the phenomena Involved.
          "Nerves are the natural conductors
          I for the electric currents In the txsly.
          When nerve tissue hardens the normal
          I control of associate muscles Is Im
          paired and bodily processes are dis
          turbed more or less seriously. In
          Other words, nature's conductor al
          the point of hardening has had Its
          resistance increased and the current
          through Hie nerve filament Is re
          duced or stopped, as the case may
          he, By means of tile beams projected
          from my high frequency X-ray tube
          the gamma rays are made to attack
          the. troubled nerve and to produce
          heat at the affected point. In this
          way the resistance due to a patho
          logical condition Is broken down, and
          the filament is restored to its rightful
          state as an electrical conductor. The
          recovered nerve then takes up its in
          tion. If the directors knew or even
          I hough I that they could have thoae
          duties equally well attcu.lid to by
          a i helper man they wouldn't keep
          on paying me as mil h as ihey do.

          The layman will very properly Ms
          How can these high frequency cur
          rents be used when ordinarily a fur
          lower order would do harm if of the
          same voltage? This Is explained on
          the basis that a bullet of low velocity
          will cause a graver wound under some
          conditions than one speeding through
          the body at a much faster rate.
          The first combats the resistance of a
          bigger area, which has had time to
          muster Its forces of opposition, and
          therefore tears or hurts a larger sec
          tion, while the speedier bullet attacks
          so rapidly that only a very small area
          has a chance to Interpose and the
          penetration or perforation Is like the
          lightning mov ment of a fine and very
          sharp needle. In the case of the
          X-ray, however, this fineness and
          sharpness are Increased beyond the
          descriptive power of words.
          The high frequency X-ray of the
          Stanley sort passes with Incredible
          swiftness through healthy body sub
          stance without effect, while it Is de
          signed to work curative wonders In
          dealing with affected or diseased tissues.

          OPPOItTUNITY FOU WOMEN'
          "It offers a flno opportunity to women,"
          Doctor Haines continued. "The work Is
          taiy compared with most work of a
          Wa'clan. and It Is Intensely Interesting.
          '.Being a comparatively new branch of
          medicine, there are very few women rep
          'resented In It, but aB the men are being
          'taken to the front, there Is an ever
          'lncreasing demand for women to Carry
          on the work.
          , "To be able really to dlagnoso tho
          'caaea and make reports on the plntes,
          one must be a graduate of a medical
          achool. For tho technical part of oper
          ating the machine unfl taking the pic
          ture, this '. not necessary. I believe
          'ther are a number of women now quail
          Ifvln as technicians."
          i Whn asked how many real Itoentgen-
          ' elorlsts there were, she apologetically
          t 'admitted that she only know of one other
          fei lln Pennsylvania. "It Is because the
          S (Office apparatus for X-ray work Is quite
          i" "Mixnslve." Doctor Haines explained.
          'Then again It Is like all spoclallst work;
          H takes a long whllo before there are
          anvreturns for your work. It Is a com-
          lug thing, however, and will be used
          more and more.
          "I want to urge women to tako up the
          work," she earnestly continued. "There
          will be so much rebuilding of men nnd
          wonten ufter the war that the X-ray
          lll be Indispensable. While It Is rather
          minute, specialized work, It la not any
          more trying than other work ; In fact Is
          not so hard. I get vejy tired nt times
          hut then I don't blame my work but my
          telf." Doctor Haines has other cares, for she

          sional woman and mother, who ts be
          itlanlng to make herself felt In American

          matter of fact it anounts to nothing

          The X-nnyn -War Work.
          'V?6 had somo' hint of 'this protective
          uie of the, X-ra? during tho earlier
          days of the recent conflict; while wo
          w'erp ofllfclally neiltral and, therefore,
          fertile ground for' (he workings of en
          emy agents or nympath'lscrs bent Upon
          getting contraband commodities cov
          ec'tly through the blockade. One of
          the most striking examples of the un
          covering of this sort of trickery was
          when" the X-ray brought 'to light the
          presence of prohibited rubber tucked
          away In 'the bowels of lnhftcent looking
          bales of cotton destined primarily' to
          Italian Consignees -Italy' at the time
          being still" at peace" WltH the Central;
          Pqwers.
          'Rubber was at a premium In Ger
          many, and the Teutons resorted to
          v;ery possible expedient 'io obtain the
          reedf ul .material, besp'lte' tho exercise
          of every ordinary precaution, the stuff
          was undoubtedly going from this side
          of the Atlantic Indirectly, to Austria
          nnd Germany. Finally .suspicion cen
          tred upon tho shipments of raw cot
          ton, but the problem tvUs how to dis
          cover the contraband without pulling
          evory bale to pieces.- Tho solution
          was offered by Richard JIuUer, a Bel
          gian engineer, of Columbia University.
          Ho proposed X-ray .apparatus and was
          put in charge of the work on some of
          the steamship piers,. Whllo rubber Is
          not-as resistant or opaque to Roentgen
          rays as metals, still the .sheet material
          rolled up and tucked away In. the mass
          of enveloping cottom was siinlctenlly
          different in Its opposition to the pas
          sage of the beams to register a blurred
          Image on tbe negative, Jn this way.
          In a single c6nslgnmcnt, contraband
          rubber was detected. In 178 bales!
          Similarly the X-ray was used dur
          ing the period of tho war by our own
          authorities and the consular or secret
          service of our allies to reveal other
          contraband, substances packed In a
          manner that was calculated to conceal
          their presence pretty effectually at
          least from tho unaided human eye.
          That Is to say, In some cases tho
          prohibited commodities were dissolved
          and therefore .appeared In qulto an
          other form. A good' many of these
          would have got by the Inspectors, "but
          for the X-ray showing them up In
          their true character.

          metal, as most of us know, melts at a
          tomperaturo of 3,000 'degrees Centi
          grade; while' platinum, which was pre
          viously used, became fluid at 1,760 de

          ELI,, Major Glevres reports
          another shortago to-day
          when thoy unloaded tho
          usual automatic shipment. Yesterday
          It was Is-sur-Tllle. To-morrow I sup
          poso It will bo somo other depot that
          will report a thortage. If tho check
          ing out records aro correct, we are be
          ing systematically robbed. For tho
          past month various supplies, Including
          cigars, cigarettes, candy and tobacco,
          amounting in value to thousands 'of
          dollars, havo disappeared. For want of
          proof to the contrary we must accept
          the records Of both the man who
          checks tho supplies as they are" loaded
          Into tho cars, and .also nf the man
          who checks theso fame cars when
          they are unloaded Into the depo. It
          Is a serious rnattor. Gleves reports
          to-day a shortago of ten bags of flour,
          Ave boxes of bacon, two boxes each of
          tobacco, cigars, cigarettes and candy
          all out of two P. Li. and M. cars. Col.
          M swears that the supplies were
          loaded; white Col B at Glevres is
          ail positive that they were not in the
          cars when they wero unloaded. It
          Is one of two things either some one
          is lying about their check records or
          there Is an organized gang of thieves
          at work. It is your task to ferret out
          tho truth and see that tho guilty ones
          are punished."
          Such was tho prize I drew at the
          morning conference in the General's
          offlco.
          "But, General," I replied, "you must
          remember that my military police
          force is very small now. The recent
          order to send every available man to
          tho front as replacements has sadly
          depleted my forces. To-day I havo
          only 148 men for duty, and if I with
          draw men from ono place, It will be
          merely 'robbing Peter to pay Paul."
          Of course we will do the best we can;
          but with my small force we cannot do
          the Impossible."
          For a long time we had known that
          thero -KT3 more or less petty thievery,
          stream of olectrons rushing from the
          cathode' to the target, and this in turn
          added to tho penetratlvo power of the
          resultant X-rays.
          Since then tho experts of the Gen
          eral Electric Company and physicists
          elsewhere have been busy widening
          the fields of application of the Cool
          ldgo tube and some very suggestive
          results have been obtained. More
          than that, practical minded scientists
          have found Industrial services for this
          searching agency that havo proved of
          conspicuous value. Even before war
          began one groat American cartridge
          factory was' equipped with a radio
          graphic oiitht which made It qulto
          practicable to take pictures of the fin
          ished ammunition and thus to estab
          lish conclusively whether or not all
          was right within the metal containers.
          This facility had been long desired
          both to Insure safety while in storage
          and satisfaction to the ultimate user,
          The radiographs revealed clearly the
          presence of any flairs In the brass cas
          ings and Insured tho withdrawal of tho
          stock before It could be shipped away
          from tho factory.
          But the prying eye of tho Intensified
          ray was soon put to a service much
          more exacting than that of penetrating
          the thin metal envelope Of fixed ammu ,

          this wo had a small detail' of picked
          detectives who kept a closo watch, not
          only on tho men who Were loading the
          cars, but also on the loaded cars In
          the railroad yards. Frequently they
          would arrest some one for having cig
          arettes candy or tobacco. In their pos
          session even one of the Captains who
          had charge of part of the docks had
          been arrested and convicted of steal
          ing cigars. But this new loss was an
          entirely different thing; soldiers
          might tako small articles, but ten bags
          of flour was too much for any of them
          to get away with.
          At this time the French people were
          in great need of flour, sugar, fats and
          'tobacco. Any one who .could secure
          such supplies was sure of a ready
          market at a high price, and no ques
          tions would be asked as to the source
          of supply. As a matter of fact, the
          thief was sure of protection if any one
          tried to discover where he obtained his
          supply. On this account our case was
          doubly difficult.
          In working up the case we first In
          stalled a double check system at both
          the loading and the unloading depots.
          But two weeks of this convinced us
          that the loss occurred after the cars
          were loaded and before they urrlved
          at their destination. As the majority
          of our cars were handled on French
          trains and by French crews, we Anally
          came to the conclusion that the steal
          ing was done by these crews.
          French Trains, a' Joke.
          Compared with our freight trains,
          the French freight train is a Joke
          slowly they wander across France,
          stopping whenever and wherever the
          engineer may desire. And Instead of
          a caboose for the train crew, they are
          forced to ride in little cubbyholes on
          the ends of tho cars. It Is impossible
          to hide on the top of the trains, and a
          man who tries it is soon knocked off
          by a bridge or a tunnel. Theso con
          ditions mado It hazardous for our men
          who were detailed to shadow tho va
          rious train crews. And, owing to the
          fact that they were forced to remain
          hidden In tho little cubbyholes, they
          were not successful In learning where
          tho stealing was done.
          Our efforts were not bringing the
          results whloh I had hoped for; and no
          one knows how1 long wo might havo
          worked on this case but for a fortu
          nate clue which camo from an unex
          pected source.
          One night after a dinner at ono of
          the hotels In the city I discovered that
          I had neglected to bring any cigars
          with me. I knew that the French
          cigars were both poor and expensive,
          but I hod to have my smoke, so I de
          cided to try and get one from the
          hotel. I called the head waiter and
          asked him If he could get me a cigar
          or a cigarette. As I was well known
          to this man I suppose he was anxious
          to please me, for he replied:
          "Tes, Major, I can get you a. real
          American cigar. In fact, can give,
          you a choice of several brands, nqt
          concern engaged in building' massive
          steel safes found It expedient to pro
          vide Itself with a powerful X-ray
          equipment so that it would be ablo to
          tako radiographs of Its hardened mate
          rial before working the metal Into ex
          pensive fireproof and burglarproof
          safes. In this way each sheet of steel
          was examined for defects, and by this
          precaution it was posslblo for them to
          be reasonably 'sure that the evildoer
          would find his task of breaking Into the
          strongbox a longer and a more difficult
          one thus Increasing tho chance of de
          tection, while tho elimination of Imper
          fect plates would also tend to protect
          tho contents that much better against
          tho searing or consuming flames of a
          conflagration.
          Used to Examine Steel.
          And while wo aro on the subject of
          steel, the French have latterly been
          using Coolldgo tubes somewhat exten
          sively In examining castings, Ac, of
          tnis metal. On a regular industrial
          scale they have found It easy to make
          radiographs after tho beams passed
          through four Inches of hardened steel,
          and flaws of small dimensions, other
          wise obscured, have been brought to
          light. That is to say, defects having a
          width or diameter of one sixty-fourth
          of an Inch could bo detected. This is
          not surprising if we recall tho work
          three or four years back of Dr.
          Wheeler P. Davey of the research
          laboratory of the General Electric
          Company. This physicist at that time
          established the fact that the Coolldgo
          tube ho then used could make a nega
          tlvo through an Interposed sheet of
          steel an inch and a quarter thick and
          bring out distinctly an air gap as thin
          as 0.025 Inch.
          Manifestly, the poer thus to ex
          amine metal parts and to learn of
          any internal shortcomings is of great
          valuo because It thereby gives warn
          ing of the unsatisfactory nature of
          the material and saves the time and
          labor that would otherwise be spent
          in machining it. Not only that, but
          this precaution guards against a sub
          sequent accident that might entail
          very serious consequences. As Dr.
          Davey has said: "It Is of course self
          evident that a radiograph gives only
          the gross structure of tho metal, and
          gives no information as to tho 'grain,'
          crystal interlocking at tho edge of a
          weld, c. A radiograph does, how
          ever, give valuable Information as to
          the presenco of blow holes,, slag In
          clusions, porous spots and defects of
          like nature which could otherwise not
          be found except by cutting Into the
          metal."
          Tho French have found radiographs
          to be exceedingly useful in examining
          aluminum weldings, and likewise in
          searching for blow holes in castings
          made of certain new alloys. Depend
          ing upon the thickness of the material
          so Inspected, tho exposure of the plate
          ranges anywhere from one to five
          minutes. They havo also used the
          Coolldgo tubefor. testing the sound
          ness of shell fuses, spark plugs of
          Internal combustion engines, Ac, the

          only of cigars, but also, of cigarettes"
          and he named over several well
          known brands that were for sale only
          in the quartermaster canteens. I asked
          him if he would bo willing to sell me
          more than one, and he answered:
          "Surely; I can sell you a whole
          box. if you desire. Ordinarily we only
          sell these to our own French tradet
          but you are different." So I purchased
          three cigars and a package of ciga
          rettes. As soon as possible without ex
          citing suspicion! I left the hotel and
          Immediately returned to my ofllce and
          summoned several of my detectives
          for a conference. I then detailed them
          to ascertain where this hotel was ob
          talnlng its supply of American tobacco.
          One of them secured work In the hotel
          at n waiter. Ho discovered that the
          head porter was the man who had the
          cigars and that he brought a certain
          amount of them from his home to th9
          hotel as needed.
          Other men were sent to shadow this
          man after ho left the hotel, and al
          though he was under our surveillance
          for a long time they were unablo to
          learn where ho was obtaining his sup
          plies. Wo next detailed one of our women
          operatives ,on the cose. She was In
          structed to becomo friendly with this
          man and, see If she, In her turn, could
          not uncover the source of supply. She
          established herself In the hotel as a

          perience he has had. In fact Is still

          "Ho met this beggar first about a
          year ago. The circumstances attend
          ing this Arst meeting were novel and
          interesting and my friend wrote a little
          piece about it which was printed In
          his newspaper and for which he re
          ceived $3. As he had given the beggar
          a nickel he figured that his net profit
          on this was $2.05. But:
          "A couple of weeks later he again
          mot this beggar, who again asked for
          a nickel, a request that my friend did
          not feel warranted in refusing. I don't
          thfhk he would have refused anyway,
          he being rather an easy mark for beg
          gars) but, having proflted by his origi
          nal transaction with this beggar, he
          felt impelled to hand over this second
          nickel promptly; thus reducing his
          net on the little piece to J-.90.
          "It wasn't long before my friend
          discovered that this beggar lived some
          where in his neighborhood and made
          that part of tho town his quarry; for
          now he used to meet him hero and
          there at Intervals. Not. always, by
          any means, when they met did the
          beggar approach him; commonly they
          passed each other as any other two
          might do, with no sign of recognition;
          but once In a while the beggar would
          ask for a nickel, which always my

          more or less complex fabrications.
          One of the particular bugaboos, of
          the wire manufacturer especially
          makers of copper wire for electric
          service Is the more or less minute
          cavities which form In tho mass of
          the metal from which the wlro Is
          subsequently drawn.' Take copper, for
          Instance. At the start, the material
          la cast Into an ingot that is after
          ward rolled Into rods, and theso are
          then fed Into tho dies of tho drawing
          machine. "When the ingots are cast
          tho gases in tho molten metal are
          caught and held In the rapidly solidi
          fying coppor more often than other
          wise rather deep seated and the cavi
          ties thus formed aro either rolled to

          the character of halrllko Internal
          fractures. The surfaces of these bub
          bles In the copper are coated with an
          oxldo, and because of this, even though
          tho metal may bo heated to Incandes
          cence, thoy will not weld under
          pressure, but persist as a weakness
          which Is pretty sure to give under
          stress.

          are mado manifest at once. Copper

          desirability of making certain that the
          copper Is sound before It Is fed to the

          guest and soon became acquainted
          with the man whom we ware watch
          ing. Among the Arst things a de
          tective learns aro these: If you wish
          a woman to talk make, her Jealous';
          but, on tho other hand, If It's a man
          ou are after send a pretty girl aftel
          him and havo her Aatter him, and, be
          fore long ho will tell her all ho knows.
          A close study of this man convinced us
          that he was susceptible to Aattery,
          Consequently our woman detective was
          qulto 'successful and in a short time,
          learned that ho was securing his sup
          plies from a woman who lived near
          cur headquarters.
          Men wero detailed on this angle of
          the case. Her homo was watched con
          tinually and she was followed when
          she went to deliver supplies at the
          hemo of the head porter and although
          wo saw her frequently taking pack
          ages out of her house yet we never
          saw the supplies taken In. We wero
          stumped. For wo knew that If sho
          was taking them out she must havo
          somo way of getting them In but Just
          how was the question. In order to
          gain entrance and search It without
          even the French police knowing about
          It was a problem. But our woman de
          tective soon solved that for us.
          This was her manner of solving it:
          She applied for rooms at this woman's
          homo, representing herself as the
          sweetheart of an American officer.
          This officer frequently called and took
          Friend's Beggar
          friend gave. In this way In the course
          of three months he gave up 35 cents,
          thus reducing the net of that 3 to
          $2.65. Then my friend had an idea.
          "He foresaw that if this went on in
          dcflnltely, as thero seemed every Indi
          cation It would do, the beggar would
          get all of the J3, which to my friend
          seemed scarcely reasonable. But he
          did think that an even division would
          bo no moro than right to the beggar,
          and so when the $3 had got down to
          $2.65 ho set asldo, in his mind, $1.15
          as a drawing account to tho beggar's
          credit," and he said to himself that
          when tho beggar had drawn that,
          when tHus tho original fund had, beon
          evenly divided, he would stop giving
          and consider that ho had dono the
          square thing.
          "Well, my friend tells me that,
          counting a nickel that the beggar
          drew yesterday, lie has now drawn
          $1.40, so that now It Is a question of
          a very few weeks only, three or four
          at the utmost, when the beggar will
          havo drawn his full share.
          "Then, my friend eays, he is going
          to shut down and keep the rest him
          self; but what I think he will do will
          be to keep on paying till the whole
          three dollars Is gone, his original proflt
          being .thus wiped out completely. I
          don't know what he can do then, un

          SHQ-PSUN CARTRIDGES UNDER. 6A.i X-RAY
          done on that side of the Atlantic by
          Sir Robert Hadflcld and others looking
          to tho use of the X-ray for making
          tests, on a commercial scale, of metal
          castings. This ls quite In keeping
          with kindred work done In France. It
          seems that It is not only possible to
          thus perceive defects that would other
          wise remain hidden, but It is also feas
          ible to make a rough or general char
          acterizing analysis of differing sorts of
          steel. For Instance, at one of the
          plants It was proved that bars of car
          bon steel and of tungsten steel if
          mixed by- accident could again, be sep
          arated and identified by means of the
          X-ray. This is becauso carbon steel Is
          more resistant to the passage of tho
          rays than tungsten steel, and there
          fore the radiographs of the latter
          metal aro not so black as those of tho
          other material.
          It Is certainly only a question of
          time or of the strength of the X-ray
          tubo before metal bodies of a wide va
          riety will be subjected to rapid and
          complete radiographing. There Is noth
          ing now Impossible In applying this
          method of inspection to car wheels and
          trunk lino rails. In this way fruitful
          sources of railroad accidents can be
          eliminated. In the amo manner cer
          tain feature's of automobiles can bo
          looked into before they aro assembled
          and the cars are distributed for use.
          It is quite evident that moro and more
          will the engineers and builders of air
          craft have to know Just what is the
          internal condition of the various ele
          ments that constitute the getup of fly
          ing machines. Every pound possib'.e
          must be saved tn order that the maxi
          mum of lightness commensurate with
          strength can be secured. Therefore
          mere mass as a safeguard cannot be
          tolerated. Reliance hereafter will rest
          upon soundness of tho materials used.

          In her arms.
          Grocer Lonir Snajiected,
          This wholesale grocery business was
          owned nnd operated by a Jew of tho
          name of Simons. He had long been
          suspected of crooked dealings by tho
          French police, but through somo mys
          terlous Influence he had been ablo to
          evade their net Wo followed her to
          tho home of tho head porter, where
          sho carried this bundle. On tho next
          day our man who was posing as a
          waiter reported that tho head porter
          hnd a fresh supply of cigars so at
          last wo had learned tho source of
          supply.
          Having discovered that tho cigars
          wero coming from this warehouse, our
          next object was to gain an. entrance
          for tho purpose of learning how great
          a quantity of stolen" goods this Jew
          had on hand. Various attempts made
          by our men to enter this building
          failed, so In desperation wo hired thji
          house next door and started a tunnel
          from it Into the cellar of the 'ware
          house. Wo Anally broko through and,
          on looking over his stock, we dis
          covered thousands of dollars' worth of
          all kinds of American goods, which
          had been stolen from the Quartermas
          ter's department.
          AH the while that we had been work
          ing on this phase "of tho case our rail
          road detectives hafl been busy checking
          uptho various train crews. They dis
          covered that the robberies always took
          placo when a certain crew was run
          ning the train. Two men were .detailed
          to ride on their train and check up the
          places where It stopped. When their
          report was mado we sent out men to
          cover these places and then wo discov
          ered Just how they" operated.
          About thirty miles up the line the
          train stopped for water. While tho
          train was stopped tho crow would go to
          a certain box car, open It and select
          what they wanted, carry It down the
          embankment and htdo It in the woods
          near by. Then the train would set oft
          an empty box car and start on, Others
          would then" gather up the stolen sup
          plies and would carry them, up to the
          station, where they were placed in the
          i , , I
          and happily radiographs will prove
          this beyond peradventuro.
          Probably ono of the most novel ap
          plications of radiography Is that re
          cently described In tho Pacific Afarlne
          Review. The author points out how It
          Is possible to use this system for the
          Inspection of the various parts of a
          Veenforced concrete ship. Tho object.
          In the first place, is to make sure that
          the mix Is compact and that the reen
          forcing metal has not been displaced
          during the casting of the concrete
          around it. Again, the aim Is to see
          to It that there are no voids In the
          AM X-RAY oTAN X-RAY TURF
          WHICH IS SOMETHING OUT of Cab
          ORDINARY
          mass of the concrete, for these would
          represent weaknesses. Successful ra
          diographs wero made through sixteen
          Inches of concrete, the steel bars being
          placed mldtvay, and the resulting nega
          tives were excellent. Tbe assertion is
          made that still greater thickness of
          concrete can bo pierced by these tell
          tale rays.
          It seems that tho outfit used for the
          work was readily portable, weighed
          Robbers
          'box car which this same train had
          placed on. the sidetrack.
          When the crew who robbed the cars
          made thelr return trip they would nick
          up this car and bring it back down the
          llnp toward Bordeaux. Just outsido
          of the city was an old abandoned track
          and the crew would set this car off
          there. On the next night tho grocery
          company would send out its wagons,
          haul the goods Into the city and put
          them In the warehouse. They would
          then repack tho various commodities
          and sell them to dishonest dealers in
          the city.
          One of tho features that was puz
          zling us was hbw the train crew knew
          which car to enter and how1 they could
          reseal It with' our seals after . hav
          ing onco broken into the car. -From
          this wo were convinced that -there
          must bb somo one on the docks who
          was In league -with the robbers; so we
          detailed men to cover that side of the
          case. A close watch of tho various
          checkers was kept. And then wo dis
          covered that one of these men after he
          had checked a load of supplies which
          the thieves wanted would put a chalk
          mark on the end of tho car so that
          when the crew saw It they would know
          that that was the right car to break
          lntp. This man had also supplied them
          with plenty of black lead seals and had
          In some way contrived to give them
          one of our seal presses so that they
          were ablo to reseal tho car after rob
          bing It.
          Blmon'a Place la Ilalded.
          In order to secure absolute proof of
          the guilt of (hem all, we arrested the
          checker and then loaded a car with
          marked boxes and arranged that It
          should havo the secret mark of the
          thieves and that It should go, out on
          the train that they were In' charge
          of. Exactly as we planned, they
          broke Into that car and stole sev
          eral of the marked boxes and
          carried them down tho embankment
          and hid them. Wo kept a sharp watch
          on them meanwhile and allowed them
          to place the stolen goods In tho other
          car and return it to Bordeaux. We
          even allowed Simon to unload the car
          and carry the supplies Into his ware
          house. Then wo called in the French
          and raided Simon's placo.' We found
          his 'warehouses full of American
          goods; In fact It required seven motor
          trucks to haul it all back to the docks.
          It Inventoried soveral thousands of
          dollars. How much ho had sold; be
          sides, no ono knew.
          We arrested the entire train crew,
          tho station master of the small place
          where the car was reloaded, and all
          of Simon's men, as well as Slmpn him
          self. Simon's pull could not savo him
          this time, and we sent htm to Jail for
          fifteen years. The others received sen
          tences that varied from two to fifteen
          years. Investigation could not con
          nect the woman or the head porter
          with the thefts, so they wero .allowed
          to go with a reprimand from the judge,
          11
          something .like ninety ppunds, and Its
          cost was not -deemed at all excessive j
          In view of the valuable service per- (
          formed by it. We aro Informed: "The i
          method here described will also be val-'
          uable for examination of vessels after
          actual sea experience with a view to ;
          detecting any flaws or deteriorations
          that may bo developing. In- connection '
          with the experimental work necossar-
          lly Involved In present day ship con
          struction there is a large field of use- !
          fulness for the X-ray In tho caso of 1
          the electrically welded steel ship as (
          well as In that of the concrete ship." -
          Among the many interesting practi
          cal applications of the X-ray tubo Is
          that as an aid to pearl fishermen. Thla '
          has reached a thoroughly commercial
          stage In the waters -of Coyion. Thou-,
          sands of potentially valuablo pearls
          have been lost to tho world by the un
          timely opening of the oyster, and, on
          the other hand, millions of these bi
          valves havo been needlessly destroyed
          in prying them open for1 pearls that
          aren't there. Accordingly tho desire
          was long felt that some means should
          be perfected by which oysters could bo
          examined quickly without hurting
          them so that tho existence or non
          existence of pearls Inside of them could
          be determined and if tho developing
          gems thus discovered should bo of un
          marketable value then tho oysters
          could be replanted, located and given'
          time to mature their precious contents.
          The X-ray tubo has supplied tho de
          sired medium to this end.
          How the apparatus works is thus de
          scribed by tho inventor: "In actual
          working tho radiographs are brought
          wet. out of the process building,
          wherein all exposures and develop
          ments are made In 'dark room' light,
          and with good light and the wet radio- '
          graph practically nothing can escape.
          Tho plant on Ipantivu Island (Coyion),
          with its single tubo equipment can
          radiograph up to 400 oysters per min
          ute. So far as concerns the possibility
          of radiographing pearl bearing oysters
          on n commercial scalo In order to dis
          close tho contained pearls and without
          injury in ani,way.0"tho oysters, my
          process has proved" to bo a comploto
          success!" , '
          Piercing 'TTatnre's Secrecy.
          Tho X-ray is helping tho scientist'
          Increasingly month by month, and en-,
          abllng him to pierce nature's veil of
          secrecy in a manner that is of both
          theoretical and' material benefit. For
          instance, it is .now possible for thp
          .physicist to study tho properties of
          crystals and to learn of tho composite
          makeup of many materials thus re-'
          veallng tho steps or processes by which
          they have evolved. Slmlllarly, radi
          ography is facilitating tho identification
          ,of real and of artificial gems. Perhaps
          we might ordinarily not-bo disposed to,
          class coal among the gems, but all of
          us aro aware that it is ojily one form
          of carbon, of which the diamond is an
          other manifestation. Just the same the
          X-ray apparatus is now being used by
          the investigator to study the Internal
          composition of different kinds -of coal
          and by tho streaks or shadows cast
          upon the negative to broadly Identify
          the nature of the coal's constituents.
          Quite apart from thus disclosing tho
          percentage of ash nnd carbon, this
          rlercing eyo of science Is opening up
          to us vistas that lead far, far back
          Into the distant past so that we can
          trace somo of the succeeding actions
          that took placo upon the earth's sur
          face when that fuel was in the form
          ing. Speaking of what this line of
          investigation may mean to the student
          of geology. Prof. G. A. Lebour, Arm
          strong College, Newcastle, England,
          has said: "It should be remembered
          that each band of this kind (the
          streaks In tho radiograph) represents
          an Interruption In the steady growth
          of a coal seam, due in most cases
          probably to temporary flooding by
          water, but sometimes to earth move
          ments or to such occurrences as dust
          or sandstorms." Thus an X-ray pic
          ture of a piece bt coal may constitute
          a graphic meteorological record of
          days thousands ' of years gone.
          Radiographs have been found of
          distinct help In foiling picture frauds,
          in uncovering the thefts of "old mas
          ters" cloaked for tho time being by
          misleading coloring and images, and
          during the past Ave years the X-ray
          played a prime part in Anding out the
          contents of postal matter which, for
          good and sufficient reasons, the au
          thorities wished to reach its destina
          tion without showing any tlgns what
          ever of having been opened or tam
          pered with. Enough has been de
          scribed of the manifold and differing
          uses to which the X-ray tube can be
          put apart from an aid to medicine to
          show how simple after, all is the pro
          posal to use these penetrating beams
          to show up the character of masquer
          ading boinbs. Onco direoverlng the
          distinctive nature of theso menacing,
          contrivances It will be qulto a simple
          matter to know how quickest and
          safest to render them Impotent

          Important Discovery Is Made by
          Professor at Harvard Uni
          versity
          While it Is emphatically stated by
          Professor Duane that neither X rnys
          nor radium should bo considered a
          permanent cure for all kinds of can

          erecting a new building adjoining the

          What Discovery Means
          The significance of tho discovery
          was explained In the following state
          ment nt Harvard
          The advantage of X rays over ra
          dium Is that the latter Is scarce and
          Immensely cxpensle costing at pres
          ent mora than 100000 a gram and
          can therefore only be used In small
          quantities If X rnjs were used It
          would be possible to make the rays
          enormously more powerful than has
          been possible with the limited amount
          of radium available
          Tho trouble with tho use of X
          rays up to this time has been that
          they pre not as penetrating as the
          so called Gamma rays of radium and
          the1 problem of tho Harvard physicists
          has been to securo this needed qual
          ity
          It wns known that to secure pene
          tration It wns necessary to secure a
          high frequency of vlbratfon The
          Harvard physicists after many ex
          periments found that a physical law
          known as tho quantum law applied
          to the X ray spectrum nnd discovered
          that they could Increase tho frequency
          of the rnys arid thus their penetra
          tion by Increasing the voltage of cur
          rent used In the X ray tube
          Gets Enough Voltage
          Professor Duauo reports that the
          tube goes to pieces under a voltago of
          more than 150000 volts but that a
          sufficiently high voltago has been ob
          tained to make the X rays very nearly
          as effective for certain medical pur
          poses as tho Gamma rays of radium
          Long continued exposure to X
          rays is so dangerous to thq operator
          that the greatest pains have to be
          faken to protect him from them In

          Daily Talks With Thinking Philadelphia en Subjects They
          Knew Best
          DR. AMOS REGINALD SHIRLEY
          On Modern Use of the X-Ray
          THE uses of the X-ray in mediclne have
          been greatly extended In the last few
          years, according te Dr. Ames Reginald
          Shirley, who is in charge of the X-ray work
          at the Veterans' Bureau of this city, which
          hns ene of' the largest and best-equipped
          plants for this purpose In the United States.
          "This comparatively recent but very great
          extension of the use of the X-ray," said Dr.
          Shirley, "Is lnrgely due te the fact that It
          has new become ulmest Indispensable In
          diagnosis. It Is used very extensively
          through various methods te locate foreign
          bodies In the human sjsteni and is of great
          value In their romewil. This was one of
          the first uses of the X-ray.
          "A mere recent but fully as Important
          development of the uses of the apparatus Is
          In the diagnosis of chest and gastrointes
          tinal troubles, where lt,x value has been
          proved le be very great; in fact, a diagnosis
          of these conditions is rarely made nt the
          present time without X-ray findings. In
          the latter case the X-ray is particularly
          helpful as an aid in discovering ulcers In the
          gastre-intcstlnnl tract and the picseuee of
          tumor formations.
          Used for Treatment Purposes
          "Fer treatment purposes the X-ray Is
          being shown each jenr te have n greater and
          greater value. Originally the machine was
          used almost exclusively for radiographic
          purposes (that Is for the making of what is
          commonly known as an 'X-iay pleluie'),
          but a little later lis therapeutic lalue was
          discovered and appreciated.
          "These therapeutic benefits have been in
          creasing from jear le jenr, and at the pres
          ent time it is used largely for the treatment
          of vnrleiiB benign uud malignant tumors,
          nnd it Is also of much assistance In the
          treatment of various skin lesions. The use
          of the X-ray In the case of tumor tends te
          shut down the bleed supply te seme extent
          by creating arteritis or n thickening of the
          walls of the vessel supplying the tumor.
          "Its value in determining the condition
          and position of fragments in cases of frac
          ture is without question, nnd the radio
          graph is of great assistance In the proper
          setting of hose fragments with relation te
          each ether. This, tee, was one of the early
          medical uses of the apparatus.
          "There have been many recent improve
          ments in the mechanism of the X-ray. One
          of the most important of these nllews the
          use of n very high veltnge, pieducing a
          twenty-Inch spot-gap. This, with pieper
          precautions, hns proved of much use In n
          therapeutic way, particularly in the ense of
          malignant conditions for deep-seated lesions.
          By n spet-gnp Is meant the dlstnnee between
          two pelntH en the npparatus, using u high
          tension circuit. Fer ordinary radiographic
          work n spot-gap of from four nnd ene-nnlf
          te five inches Is penernlly used,
          "The high voltage increases the pene
          trative power, the final effect of this de
          pending te some degree upon the thickness
          of the part X-rayed.
          "Most of our own work In the bureau Is
          diagnostic. Fer this purpose we use dupltt
          lzcd films, which lessens the exposure re
          quired in radiographic work.
          Small Danger of Ilnrns
          "With proper precautions the danger of
          burns In the use of the X-ray machine is
          new se small ns te be negligible. Of course,
          it Is necessary that these precautions be
          taken both with respect te the person being
          X-rayed and the operator of the apparatus.
          It is true that tome severe burns have been
          Inflicted through the use of the X-ray ap
          paratus, but these were principally in ex
          periments nnd genernlly te the operator who
          was experimenting. With the improvement
          of the apparatus there is new no danger of
          burns either te the person being X-rayed
          or te the operator.
          "Sheet lend has been found te be the best
          preventive of X-ray burns. These burns are
          inflicted by what are known as the 'soft
          rays,' and the lead absorbs these rays.
          Sheet lead Is used between the tube and the
          opcrnter, and has been found te be very
          effective.
          "As regards the person being X-rnyed,
          the precaution which Is taken is te sce thnt
          tiie tube is a sufficient dlslance from the
          person ns te make it Impossible for it spark
          te Jump from the tube te jhe person. Tills
          Is also offset by seeing that the machlne is
          properly 'grounded.' When these- precau
          tions are observed, as they always are by
          all competent operators of the apparatus,
          there Is net a possibility of a burn being
          Inflicted.
          "A person burned by the X-ray la net
          Immediately, . conscious. of the. burn. In the
          1922

          course of time dermatitis begins, and If
          deep-seated enough It may develop in the
          underlying structure, bone and muscle ns In
          the case of a third-degree burn. But, ns T
          said, there Is new net the slightest reason
          for an X-ray burn with n competent oper
          ator. "In therapeutic work the parts of the
          patient net being treated are protected from
          the effects of ee rays bv lead-foil and lead
          rubber sheeting, se that only the parts
          requiring treatment nre exposed te the riiys.
          In rndlegrnphlc work the precautions against
          burns are effected e some degree by filter
          ing off the 'soft rays,' and for this purpose
          nluinlnum filters nre used. These 'soft ras,'
          ns I have explained, arc the ones which de
          the greatest damage.
          "The development of the apparatus has
          been In no manner greater than in the pre
          vention of bad effects from its use. In this
          respect the work has gene se far that these
          111 effects are new never produced if the
          operator of the apparatus understands it as
          be should.
          Further Uses or Kays
          "Further uses of the X-ray have been
          found in the discovery of lesions in the
          tracts of the lower part of the bedv ns weli
          as In the gall-bladder region. In time there
          will probably be great improvements In the
          apparatus, but great strides have nlready
          been made, be that lis use is new very effec
          tive nnd Is mere nnd mere recognized each
          day as tin indispensable aid te the diagnosis
          of many conditions,
          "Any part of the humnn body enn be
          safely X-rayed as long as the proper pie
          cautions ure observed. There is no reason
          with the modern improvements of the tip
          nurntus for any person te entertain any
          fear of submitting te an X-ray examination,
          as every posblble precaution, and there are
          net n great many of them necessary, is
          taken te avoid bad effects.
          "Modern medicine could net get nleng
          without the X-ray. The war proved what
          most of the phjslclans nlready knew: that
          it is Indispensable In their work. It net only
          had this effect te n greater degree than any
          event which hns transpired since the Inven
          tion or discovery of the X-ray, but it also
          removed seme skepticism In certain qunrters
          as te its therapeutic and diagnostic value.
          There Is no well-equipped hospital or clinic
          in the world today which has net Its X-rny
          apparatus.
          Used in Specialties
          "There is net n epeelnlty in medicine to
          day In which the X-ray findings de net
          play a leading pari in diagnosis, nnd often
          In treatment. In former times the physicians
          were largely dependent upon the description
          of he p.idents for their diagnosis of Inter
          nal conditions, and if the pntleni was net
          able te describe exactly or had emitted seme
          Important symptom net apparent le the
          physician, the latter was te n certain extent
          in the dnrk ns te all of the conditions which
          he was trying te correct. But new the radio
          graph will show exactly what the internnl
          conditions are.
          "The reading of a radiograph Js usually a
          question of the interpretation of the vari
          ous densities shown en it. These densities
          bear a re atlenshlp te normal and patholegl.
          cal conditions. In the diagnosis of une
          conditions especially the value of the X-ray
          npparatus Is becoming mere and mero no
